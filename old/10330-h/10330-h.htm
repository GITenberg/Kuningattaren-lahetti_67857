    <h2>
      TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FRUITFULNESS&rdquo; is the first of a series of four works in which M. Zola
      proposes to embody what he considers to be the four cardinal principles of
      human life. These works spring from the previous series of The Three
      Cities: &ldquo;Lourdes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rome,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; which dealt with the principles of
      Faith, Hope, and Charity. The last scene in &ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; when Marie, Pierre
      Froment&rsquo;s wife, takes her boy in her arms and consecrates him, so to say,
      to the city of labor and thought, furnishes the necessary transition from
      one series to the other. &ldquo;Fruitfulness,&rdquo; says M. Zola, &ldquo;creates the home.
      Thence springs the city. From the idea of citizenship comes that of the
      fatherland; and love of country, in minds fed by science, leads to the
      conception of a wider and vaster fatherland, comprising all the peoples of
      the earth. Of these three stages in the progress of mankind, the fourth
      still remains to be attained. I have thought then of writing, as it were,
      a poem in four volumes, in four chants, in which I shall endeavor to sum
      up the philosophy of all my work. The first of these volumes is
      &lsquo;Fruitfulness&rsquo;; the second will be called &lsquo;Work&rsquo;; the third, &lsquo;Truth&rsquo;; the
      last, &lsquo;Justice.&rsquo; In &lsquo;Fruitfulness&rsquo; the hero&rsquo;s name is Matthew. In the next
      work it will be Luke; in &lsquo;Truth,&rsquo; Mark; and in &lsquo;justice,&rsquo; John. The
      children of my brain will, like the four Evangelists preaching the gospel,
      diffuse the religion of future society, which will be founded on
      Fruitfulness, Work, Truth, and Justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is M. Zola&rsquo;s reply to the cry repeatedly raised by his hero,
      Abbe Pierre Froment, in the pages of &ldquo;Lourdes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rome&rdquo;: &ldquo;A
      new religion, a new religion!&rdquo; Critics of those works were careful to
      point out that no real answer was ever returned to the Abbe&rsquo;s despairing
      call; and it must be confessed that one must yet wait for the greater part
      of that answer, since &ldquo;Fruitfulness,&rdquo; though complete as a narrative,
      forms but a portion of the whole. It is only after the publication of the
      succeeding volumes that one will be able to judge how far M. Zola&rsquo;s
      doctrines and theories in their ensemble may appeal to the requirements of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      While &ldquo;Fruitfulness,&rdquo; as I have said, constitutes a first instalment of M.
      Zola&rsquo;s conception of a social religion, it embodies a good deal else. The
      idea of writing some such work first occurred to him many years ago. In
      1896 he contributed an article to the Paris <i>Figaro</i>, in which he
      said: &ldquo;For some ten years now I have been haunted by the idea of a novel,
      of which I shall, doubtless, never write the first page.... That novel
      would have been called &lsquo;Wastage&rsquo;... and I should have pleaded in it in
      favor of all the rights of life, with all the passion which I may have in
      my heart.&rdquo; * M. Zola&rsquo;s article then proceeds to discuss the various social
      problems, theories, and speculations which are set forth here and there in
      the present work. Briefly, the genesis of &ldquo;Fruitfulness&rdquo; lies in the
      article I have quoted.
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fruitfulness&rdquo; is a book to be judged from several standpoints. It would
      be unjust and absurd to judge it from one alone, such, for instance, as
      that of the new social religion to which I have referred. It must be
      looked at notably as a tract for the times in relation to certain grievous
      evils from which France and other countries&mdash;though more particularly
      France&mdash;are undoubtedly suffering. And it may be said that some such
      denunciation of those evils was undoubtedly necessary, and that nobody was
      better placed to pen that denunciation than M. Zola, who, alone of all
      French writers nowadays, commands universal attention. Whatever opinion
      may be held of his writings, they have to be reckoned with. Thus, in
      preparing &ldquo;Fruitfulness,&rdquo; he was before all else discharging a patriotic
      duty, and that duty he took in hand in an hour of cruel adversity, when to
      assist a great cause he withdrew from France and sought for a time a
      residence in England, where for eleven months I was privileged to help him
      in maintaining his incognito. &ldquo;Fruitfulness&rdquo; was entirely written in
      England, begun in a Surrey country house, and finished at the Queen&rsquo;s
      Hotel, Norwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be superfluous for me to enter here into all the questions which
      M. Zola raises in his pages. The evils from which France suffers in
      relation to the stagnancy of its population, are well known, and that
      their continuance&mdash;if continuance there be&mdash;will mean the
      downfall of the country from its position as one of the world&rsquo;s great
      powers before the close of the twentieth century, is a mathematical
      certainty. That M. Zola, in order to combat those evils, and to do his
      duty as a good citizen anxious to prevent the decline of his country,
      should have dealt with his subject with the greatest frankness and
      outspokenness, was only natural. Moreover, absolute freedom of speech
      exists in France, which is not the case elsewhere. Thus, when I first
      perused the original proofs of M. Zola&rsquo;s work, I came to the conclusion
      that any version of it in the English language would be well-nigh
      impossible. For some time I remained of that opinion, and I made a
      statement to that effect in a leading literary journal. Subsequently,
      however, my views became modified. &ldquo;The man who is ridiculous,&rdquo; wrote a
      French poet, Barthelemy, &ldquo;is he whose opinions never change,&rdquo; and thus I
      at last reverted to a task from which I had turned aside almost in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various considerations influenced me, and among them was the thought that
      if &ldquo;Fruitfulness&rdquo; were not presented to the public in an English dress, M.
      Zola&rsquo;s new series would remain incomplete, decapitated so far as British
      and American readers were concerned. After all, the criticisms dealing
      with the French original were solely directed against matters of form, the
      mould in which some part of the work was cast. Its high moral purpose was
      distinctly recognized by several even of its most bitter detractors. For
      me the problem was how to retain the whole ensemble of the narrative and
      the essence of the lessons which the work inculcates, while recasting some
      portion of it and sacrificing those matters of form to which exception was
      taken. It is not for me to say whether I have succeeded in the task; but I
      think that nothing in any degree offensive to delicate susceptibilities
      will be found in this present version of M. Zola&rsquo;s book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English reviews of the French original showed that if certain portions
      of it were deemed indiscreet, it none the less teemed with admirable and
      even delightful pages. Among the English reviewers were two well-known
      lady writers, Madame Darmesteter (formerly Miss Mary Robinson), and Miss
      Hannah Lynch. And the former remarked in one part of her critique: &ldquo;Even
      this short review reveals how honest, how moral, how human and comely is
      the fable of <i>Fecondite</i>,&rdquo; * while the latter expressed the view that
      the work was &ldquo;eminently, pugnaciously virtuous in M. Zola&rsquo;s strictly
      material conception of virtue.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;The pages that tell the story
      of Mathieu and Marianne, it must be admitted, are as charming as possible.
      They have a bloom, a beauty, a fragrance we never expected to find in M.
      Zola&rsquo;s work. The tale is a simple one: the cheerful conquest of fortune
      and the continual birth of offspring.&rdquo; **
    </p>

  ** <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, January 1900.
</pre>
    <p>
      Of course, these lady critics did not favor certain features of the
      original, and one of them, indeed, referred to the evil denounced by M.
      Zola as a mere evil of the hour, whereas it has been growing and spreading
      for half a century, gradually sapping all the vitality of France. But
      beside that evil, beside the downfall of the families it attacks, M. Zola
      portrays the triumph of rectitude, the triumph which follows faith in the
      powers of life, and observance of the law of universal labor.
      &ldquo;Fruitfulness&rdquo; contains charming pictures of homely married life,
      delightful glimpses of childhood and youth: the first smile, the first
      step, the first word, followed by the playfulness and the flirtations of
      boyhood, and the happiness which waits on the espousals of those who truly
      love. And the punishment of the guilty is awful, and the triumph of the
      righteous is the greatest that can be conceived. All those features have
      been retained, so far as my abilities have allowed, in the present
      version, which will at the same time, I think, give the reader
      unacquainted with the French language a general idea of M. Zola&rsquo;s views on
      one of the great questions of the age, as well as all the essential
      portions of a strongly conceived narrative.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      THAT morning, in the little pavilion of Chantebled, on the verge of the
      woods, where they had now been installed for nearly a month, Mathieu was
      making all haste in order that he might catch the seven-o&rsquo;clock train
      which every day conveyed him from Janville to Paris. It was already
      half-past six, and there were fully two thousand paces from the pavilion
      to Janville. Afterwards came a railway journey of three-quarters of an
      hour, and another journey of at least equal duration through Paris, from
      the Northern Railway terminus to the Boulevard de Grenelle. He seldom
      reached his office at the factory before half-past eight o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just kissed the children. Fortunately they were asleep; otherwise
      they would have linked their arms about his neck, laughed and kissed him,
      being ever unwilling to let him go. And as he hastily returned to the
      principal bedroom, he found his wife, Marianne, in bed there, but awake
      and sitting up. She had risen a moment before in order to pull back a
      curtain, and all the glow of that radiant May morning swept in, throwing a
      flood of gay sunshine over the fresh and healthy beauty of her
      four-and-twenty years. He, who was three years the elder, positively
      adored her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, my darling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must make haste, for I fear I may miss
      the train&mdash;and so manage as well as you can. You still have thirty
      sous left, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to laugh, looking charming with her bare arms and her
      loose-flowing dark hair. The ever-recurring pecuniary worries of the
      household left her brave and joyous. Yet she had been married at
      seventeen, her husband at twenty, and they already had to provide for four
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we shall be all right,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the month to-day,
      and you&rsquo;ll receive your money to-night. I&rsquo;ll settle our little debts at
      Janville to-morrow. There are only the Lepailleurs, who worry me with
      their bill for milk and eggs, for they always look as if they fancied one
      meant to rob them. But with thirty sous, my dear! why, we shall have quite
      a high time of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still laughing as she held out her firm white arms for the
      customary morning good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run off, since you are in a hurry. I will go to meet you at the little
      bridge to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I insist on your going to bed! You know very well that even if I
      catch the quarter-to-eleven-o&rsquo;clock train, I cannot reach Janville before
      half-past eleven. Ah! what a day I have before me! I had to promise the
      Moranges that I would take dejeuner with them; and this evening Beauchene
      is entertaining a customer&mdash;a business dinner, which I&rsquo;m obliged to
      attend. So go to bed, and have a good sleep while you are waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gently nodded, but would give no positive promise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to
      call on the landlord,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to tell him that the rain comes into
      the children&rsquo;s bedroom. It&rsquo;s not right that we should be soaked here as if
      we were on the high-way, even if those millionaires, the Seguins du
      Hordel, do let us have this place for merely six hundred francs a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! I should have forgotten that. I will call on them, I promise
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu took her in his arms, and there was no ending to their
      leave-taking. He still lingered. She had begun to laugh again, while
      giving him many a kiss in return for his own. There was all the love of
      bounding health between them, the joy that springs from the most perfect
      union, as when man and wife are but one both in flesh and in soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run off, run off, darling! Remember to tell Constance that, before she
      goes into the country, she ought to run down here some Sunday with
      Maurice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I will tell her&mdash;till to-night, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he came back once more, caught her in a tight embrace, and pressed to
      her lips a long, loving kiss, which she returned with her whole heart. And
      then he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He usually took an omnibus on his arrival at the Northern Railway
      terminus. But on the days when only thirty sous remained at home he
      bravely went through Paris on foot. It was, too, a very fine walk by way
      of the Rue la Fayette, the Opera-house, the Boulevards, the Rue Royale,
      and then, after the Place de la Concorde, the Cours la Reine, the Alma
      bridge, and the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene&rsquo;s works were at the very end of the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, between the
      Rue de la Federation and the Boulevard de Grenelle. There was hereabouts a
      large square plot, at one end of which, facing the quay, stood a handsome
      private house of brickwork with white stone dressings, that had been
      erected by Leon Beauchene, father of Alexandre, the present master of the
      works. From the balconies one could perceive the houses which were perched
      aloft in the midst of greenery on the height of Passy, beyond the Seine;
      whilst on the right arose the campanile of the Trocadero palace. On one
      side, skirting the Rue de la Federation, one could still see a garden and
      a little house, which had been the modest dwelling of Leon Beauchene in
      the heroic days of desperate toil when he had laid the foundations of his
      fortune. Then the factory buildings and sheds, quite a mass of grayish
      structures, overtopped by two huge chimneys, occupied both the back part
      of the ground and that which fringed the Boulevard de Grenelle, the latter
      being shut off by long windowless walls. This important and well-known
      establishment manufactured chiefly agricultural appliances, from the most
      powerful machines to those ingenious and delicate implements on which
      particular care must be bestowed if perfection is to be attained. In
      addition to the hundreds of men who worked there daily, there were some
      fifty women, burnishers and polishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entry to the workshops and offices was in the Rue de la Federation,
      through a large carriage way, whence one perceived the far-spreading yard,
      with its paving stones invariably black and often streaked by rivulets of
      steaming water. Dense smoke arose from the high chimneys, strident jets of
      steam emerged from the roof, whilst a low rumbling and a shaking of the
      ground betokened the activity within, the ceaseless bustle of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thirty-five minutes past eight by the big clock of the central
      building when Mathieu crossed the yard towards the office which he
      occupied as chief designer. For eight years he had been employed at the
      works where, after a brilliant and special course of study, he had made
      his beginning as assistant draughtsman when but nineteen years old,
      receiving at that time a salary of one hundred francs a month. His father,
      Pierre Froment,* had four sons by Marie his wife&mdash;Jean the eldest,
      then Mathieu, Marc, and Luc&mdash;and while leaving them free to choose a
      particular career he had striven to give each of them some manual calling.
      Leon Beauchene, the founder of the works, had been dead a year, and his
      son Alexandre had succeeded him and married Constance Meunier, daughter of
      a very wealthy wall-paper manufacturer of the Marais, at the time when
      Mathieu entered the establishment, the master of which was scarcely five
      years older than himself. It was there that Mathieu had become acquainted
      with a poor cousin of Alexandre&rsquo;s, Marianne, then sixteen years old, whom
      he had married during the following year.
    </p>

  *  Of <i>Lourdes</i>, <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Paris</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Marianne, when only twelve, had become dependent upon her uncle, Leon
      Beauchene. After all sorts of mishaps a brother of the latter, one Felix
      Beauchene, a man of adventurous mind but a blunderhead, had gone to
      Algeria with his wife and daughter, there to woo fortune afresh; and the
      farm he had established was indeed prospering when, during a sudden
      revival of Arab brigandage, both he and his wife were murdered and their
      home was destroyed. Thus the only place of refuge for the little girl, who
      had escaped miraculously, was the home of her uncle, who showed her great
      kindness during the two years of life that remained to him. With her,
      however, were Alexandre, whose companionship was rather dull, and his
      younger sister, Seraphine, a big, vicious, and flighty girl of eighteen,
      who, as it happened, soon left the house amid a frightful scandal&mdash;an
      elopement with a certain Baron Lowicz, a genuine baron, but a swindler and
      forger, to whom it became necessary to marry her. She then received a
      dowry of 300,000 francs. Alexandre, after his father&rsquo;s death, made a money
      match with Constance, who brought him half a million francs, and Marianne
      then found herself still more a stranger, still more isolated beside her
      new cousin, a thin, dry, authoritative woman, who ruled the home with
      absolute sway. Mathieu was there, however, and a few months sufficed:
      fine, powerful, and healthy love sprang up between the young people; there
      was no lightning flash such as throws the passion-swayed into each other&rsquo;s
      arms, but esteem, tenderness, faith, and that mutual conviction of
      happiness in reciprocal bestowal which tends to indissoluble marriage. And
      they were delighted at marrying penniless, at bringing one another but
      their full hearts forever and forever. The only change in Mathieu&rsquo;s
      circumstances was an increase of salary to two hundred francs a month.
      True, his new cousin by marriage just vaguely hinted at a possible
      partnership, but that would not be till some very much later date.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened Mathieu Froment gradually became indispensable at the
      works. The young master, Alexandre Beauchene, passed through an anxious
      crisis. The dowry which his father had been forced to draw from his
      coffers in order to get Seraphine married, and other large expenses which
      had been occasioned by the girl&rsquo;s rebellious and perverse conduct, had
      left but little working capital in the business. Then, too, on the morrow
      of Leon Beauchene&rsquo;s death it was found that, with the carelessness often
      evinced in such matters, he had neglected to leave a will; so that
      Seraphine eagerly opposed her brother&rsquo;s interests, demanding her personal
      share of the inheritance, and even suggesting the sale of the works. The
      property had narrowly escaped being cut up, annihilated. And Alexandre
      Beauchene still shivered with terror and anger at the recollection of that
      time, amidst all his delight at having at last rid himself of his sister
      by paying her in money the liberally estimated value of her share. It was
      in order to fill up the void thus created in his finances that he had
      espoused the half-million represented by Constance&mdash;an ugly creature,
      as he himself bitterly acknowledged, coarse male as he was. Truth to tell,
      she was so thin, so scraggy, that before consenting to make her his wife
      he had often called her &ldquo;that bag of bones.&rdquo; But, on the other hand,
      thanks to his marriage with her, all his losses were made good in five or
      six years&rsquo; time; the business of the works even doubled, and great
      prosperity set in. And Mathieu, having become a most active and necessary
      coadjutor, ended by taking the post of chief designer, at a salary of four
      thousand two hundred francs per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morange, the chief accountant, whose office was near Mathieu&rsquo;s, thrust his
      head through the doorway as soon as he heard the young man installing
      himself at his drawing-table. &ldquo;I say, my dear Froment,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget that you are to take dejeuner with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my good Morange, it&rsquo;s understood. I will look in for you at
      twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu very carefully scrutinized a wash drawing of a very simple
      but powerful steam thresher, an invention of his own, on which he had been
      working for some time past, and which a big landowner of Beauce, M.
      Firon-Badinier, was to examine during the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the master&rsquo;s private room was suddenly thrown wide open and
      Beauchene appeared&mdash;tall, with a ruddy face, a narrow brow, and big
      brown, protruding eyes. He had a rather large nose, thick lips, and a full
      black beard, on which he bestowed great care, as he likewise did on his
      hair, which was carefully combed over his head in order to conceal the
      serious baldness that was already coming upon him, although he was
      scarcely two-and-thirty. Frock-coated the first thing in the morning, he
      was already smoking a big cigar; and his loud voice, his peals of gayety,
      his bustling ways, all betokened an egotist and good liver still in his
      prime, a man for whom money&mdash;capital increased and increased by the
      labor of others&mdash;was the one only sovereign power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! it&rsquo;s ready, is it not?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;Monsieur Firon-Badinier has
      again written me that he will be here at three o&rsquo;clock. And you know that
      I&rsquo;m going to take you to the restaurant with him this evening; for one can
      never induce those fellows to give orders unless one plies them with good
      wine. It annoys Constance to have it done here; and, besides, I prefer to
      entertain those people in town. You warned Marianne, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. She knows that I shall return by the quarter-to-eleven-o&rsquo;clock
      train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene had sunk upon a chair: &ldquo;Ah! my dear fellow, I&rsquo;m worn out,&rdquo; he
      continued; &ldquo;I dined in town last night; I got to bed only at one o&rsquo;clock.
      And there was a terrible lot of work waiting for me this morning. One
      positively needs to be made of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until a short time before he had shown himself a prodigious worker,
      endowed with really marvellous energy and strength. Moreover, he had given
      proof of unfailing business instinct with regard to many profitable
      undertakings. Invariably the first to appear at the works, he looked after
      everything, foresaw everything, filling the place with his bustling zeal,
      and doubling his output year by year. Recently, however, fatigue had been
      gaining ground on him. He had always sought plenty of amusement, even amid
      the hard-working life he led. But nowadays certain &ldquo;sprees,&rdquo; as he called
      them, left him fairly exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at Mathieu: &ldquo;You seem fit enough, you do!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How is it
      that you manage never to look tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the young man who stood there erect before his
      drawing-table seemed possessed of the sturdy health of a young oak tree.
      Tall and slender, he had the broad, lofty, tower-like brow of the
      Froments. He wore his thick hair cut quite short, and his beard, which
      curled slightly, in a point. But the chief expression of his face rested
      in his eyes, which were at once deep and bright, keen and thoughtful, and
      almost invariably illumined by a smile. They showed him to be at once a
      man of thought and of action, very simple, very gay, and of a kindly
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I,&rdquo; he answered with a laugh, &ldquo;I behave reasonably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchene protested: &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t! The man who already has four
      children when he is only twenty-seven can&rsquo;t claim to be reasonable. And
      twins too&mdash;your Blaise and your Denis to begin with! And then your
      boy Ambroise and your little girl Rose. Without counting the other little
      girl that you lost at her birth. Including her, you would now have had
      five youngsters, you wretched fellow! No, no, I&rsquo;m the one who behaves
      reasonably&mdash;I, who have but one child, and, like a prudent, sensible
      man, desire no others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He often made such jesting remarks as these, through which filtered his
      genuine indignation; for he deemed the young couple to be over-careless of
      their interests, and declared that the prolificness of his cousin Marianne
      was quite scandalous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed as Mathieu was to these attacks, which left him perfectly
      serene, he went on laughing, without even giving a reply, when a workman
      abruptly entered the room&mdash;one who was currently called &ldquo;old
      Moineaud,&rdquo; though he was scarcely three-and-forty years of age. Short and
      thick-set, he had a bullet head, a bull&rsquo;s neck, and face and hands scarred
      and dented by more than a quarter of a century of toil. By calling he was
      a fitter, and he had come to submit a difficulty which had just arisen in
      the piecing together of a reaping machine. But, his employer, who was
      still angrily thinking of over-numerous families, did not give him time to
      explain his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, old Moineaud, how many children have you?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven, Monsieur Beauchene,&rdquo; the workman replied, somewhat taken aback.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, including them, you would now have ten? Well, that&rsquo;s a nice state of
      things! How can you do otherwise than starve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moineaud began to laugh like the gay thriftless Paris workman that he was.
      The little ones? Well, they grew up without his even noticing it, and,
      indeed, he was really fond of them, so long as they remained at home. And,
      besides, they worked as they grew older, and brought a little money in.
      However, he preferred to answer his employer with a jest which set them
      all laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had explained the difficulty with the reaper, the others followed
      him to examine the work for themselves. They were already turning into a
      passage, when Beauchene, seeing the door of the women&rsquo;s workshop open,
      determined to pass that way, so that he might give his customary look
      around. It was a long, spacious place, where the polishers, in smocks of
      black serge, sat in double rows polishing and grinding their pieces at
      little work-boards. Nearly all of them were young, a few were pretty, but
      most had low and common faces. An animal odor and a stench of rancid oil
      pervaded the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulations required perfect silence there during work. Yet all the
      girls were gossiping. As soon, however, as the master&rsquo;s approach was
      signalled the chatter abruptly ceased. There was but one girl who, having
      her head turned, and thus seeing nothing of Beauchene, went on furiously
      abusing a companion, with whom she had previously started a dispute. She
      and the other were sisters, and, as it happened, daughters of old
      Moineaud. Euphrasie, the younger one, she who was shouting, was a skinny
      creature of seventeen, light-haired, with a long, lean, pointed face,
      uncomely and malignant; whereas the elder, Norine, barely nineteen, was a
      pretty girl, a blonde like her sister, but having a milky skin, and withal
      plump and sturdy, showing real shoulders, arms, and hips, and one of those
      bright sunshiny faces, with wild hair and black eyes, all the freshness of
      the Parisian hussy, aglow with the fleeting charm of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norine was ever quarrelling with Euphrasie, and was pleased to have her
      caught in a misdeed; so she allowed her to rattle on. And it thereupon
      became necessary for Beauchene to intervene. He habitually evinced great
      severity in the women&rsquo;s workshop, for he had hitherto held the view that
      an employer who jested with his workgirls was a lost man. Thus, in spite
      of the low character of which he was said to give proof in his walks
      abroad, there had as yet never been the faintest suggestion of scandal in
      connection with him and the women in his employ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, Mademoiselle Euphrasie!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;do you intend to be
      quiet? This is quite improper. You are fined twenty sous, and if I hear
      you again you will be locked out for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had turned round in consternation. Then, stifling her rage, she
      cast a terrible glance at her sister, thinking that she might at least
      have warned her. But the other, with the discreet air of a pretty wench
      conscious of her attractiveness, continued smiling, looking her employer
      full in the face, as if certain that she had nothing to fear from him.
      Their eyes met, and for a couple of seconds their glances mingled. Then
      he, with flushed cheeks and an angry air, resumed, addressing one and all:
      &ldquo;As soon as the superintendent turns her back you chatter away like so
      many magpies. Just be careful, or you will have to deal with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moineaud, the father, had witnessed the scene unmoved, as if the two girls&mdash;she
      whom the master had scolded, and she who slyly gazed at him&mdash;were not
      his own daughters. And now the round was resumed and the three men quitted
      the women&rsquo;s workshop amidst profound silence, which only the whir of the
      little grinders disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fitting difficulty had been overcome downstairs and Moineaud had
      received his orders, Beauchene returned to his residence accompanied by
      Mathieu, who wished to convey Marianne&rsquo;s invitation to Constance. A
      gallery connected the black factory buildings with the luxurious private
      house on the quay. And they found Constance in a little drawing-room hung
      with yellow satin, a room to which she was very partial. She was seated
      near a sofa, on which lay little Maurice, her fondly prized and only
      child, who had just completed his seventh year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo; inquired Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child seemed sturdily built, and he greatly resembled his father,
      though he had a more massive jaw. But he was pale and there was a faint
      ring round his heavy eyelids. His mother, that &ldquo;bag of bones,&rdquo; a little
      dark woman, yellow and withered at six-and-twenty, looked at him with an
      expression of egotistical pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! he&rsquo;s never ill,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Only he has been complaining of
      his legs. And so I made him lie down, and I wrote last night to ask Dr.
      Boutan to call this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Beauchene with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;women are all the same!
      A child who is as strong as a Turk! I should just like anybody to tell me
      that he isn&rsquo;t strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Precisely at that moment in walked Dr. Boutan, a short, stout man of
      forty, with very keen eyes set in a clean-shaven, heavy, but extremely
      good-natured face. He at once examined the child, felt and sounded him;
      then with his kindly yet serious air he said: &ldquo;No, no, there&rsquo;s nothing. It
      is the mere effect of growth. The lad has become rather pale through
      spending the winter in Paris, but a few months in the open air, in the
      country, will set him right again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; cried Beauchene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance had kept her son&rsquo;s little hand in her own. He had again
      stretched himself out and closed his eyes in a weary way, whilst she, in
      her happiness, continued smiling. Whenever she chose she could appear
      quite pleasant-looking, however unprepossessing might be her features. The
      doctor had seated himself, for he was fond of lingering and chatting in
      the houses of friends. A general practitioner, and one who more
      particularly tended the ailments of women and children, he was naturally a
      confessor, knew all sorts of secrets, and was quite at home in family
      circles. It was he who had attended Constance at the birth of that
      much-spoiled only son, and Marianne at the advent of the four children she
      already had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had remained standing, awaiting an opportunity to deliver his
      invitation. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you are soon leaving for the country, you
      must come one Sunday to Janville. My wife would be so delighted to see you
      there, to show you our encampment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he jested respecting the bareness of the lonely pavilion which they
      occupied, recounting that as yet they possessed only a dozen plates and
      five egg-cups. But Beauchene knew the pavilion, for he went shooting in
      the neighborhood every winter, having a share in the tenancy of some
      extensive woods, the shooting-rights over which had been parcelled out by
      the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seguin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a friend of mine. I have lunched at your pavilion.
      It&rsquo;s a perfect hovel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Constance, contemptuous at the idea of such poverty, recalled what
      Madame Seguin&mdash;to whom she referred as Valentine&mdash;had told her
      of the dilapidated condition of the old shooting-box. But the doctor,
      after listening with a smile, broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Seguin is a patient of mine. At the time when her last child was
      born I advised her to stay at that pavilion. The atmosphere is wholesome,
      and children ought to spring up there like couch-grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, with a sonorous laugh, Beauchene began to jest in his habitual
      way, remarking that if the doctor were correct there would probably be no
      end to Mathieu&rsquo;s progeny, numerous as it already was. But this elicited an
      angry protest from Constance, who on the subject of children held the same
      views as her husband himself professed in his more serious moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu thoroughly understood what they both meant. They regarded him and
      his wife with derisive pity, tinged with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advent of the young couple&rsquo;s last child, little Rose, had already
      increased their expenses to such a point that they had been obliged to
      seek refuge in the country, in a mere pauper&rsquo;s hovel. And yet, in spite of
      Beauchene&rsquo;s sneers and Constance&rsquo;s angry remarks, Mathieu outwardly
      remained very calm. Constance and Marianne had never been able to agree;
      they differed too much in all respects; and for his part he laughed off
      every attack, unwilling as he was to let anger master him, lest a rupture
      should ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchene waxed passionate on the subject. That question of the
      birth-rate and the present-day falling off in population was one which he
      thought he had completely mastered, and on which he held forth at length
      authoritatively. He began by challenging the impartiality of Boutan, whom
      he knew to be a fervent partisan of large families. He made merry with
      him, declaring that no medical man could possibly have a disinterested
      opinion on the subject. Then he brought out all that he vaguely knew of
      Malthusianism, the geometrical increase of births, and the arithmetical
      increase of food-substances, the earth becoming so populous as to be
      reduced to a state of famine within two centuries. It was the poor&rsquo;s own
      fault, said he, if they led a life of starvation; they had only to limit
      themselves to as many children as they could provide for. The rich were
      falsely accused of social wrong-doing; they were by no means responsible
      for poverty. Indeed, they were the only reasonable people; they alone, by
      limiting their families, acted as good citizens should act. And he became
      quite triumphant, repeating that he knew of no cause for self-reproach,
      and that his ever-growing fortune left him with an easy conscience. It was
      so much the worse for the poor, if they were bent on remaining poor. In
      vain did the doctor urge that the Malthusian theories were shattered, that
      the calculations had been based on a possible, not a real, increase of
      population; in vain too did he prove that the present-day economic crisis,
      the evil distribution of wealth under the capitalist system, was the one
      hateful cause of poverty, and that whenever labor should be justly
      apportioned among one and all the fruitful earth would easily provide
      sustenance for happy men ten times more numerous than they are now. The
      other refused to listen to anything, took refuge in his egotism, declared
      that all those matters were no concern of his, that he felt no remorse at
      being rich, and that those who wished to become rich had, in the main,
      simply to do as he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, logically, this is the end of France, eh?&rdquo; Boutan remarked
      maliciously. &ldquo;The number of births ever increases in Germany, Russia, and
      elsewhere, while it decreases in a terrible way among us. Numerically the
      rank we occupy in Europe is already very inferior to what it formerly was;
      and yet number means power more than ever nowadays. It has been calculated
      that an average of four children per family is necessary in order that
      population may increase and the strength of a nation be maintained. You
      have but one child; you are a bad patriot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Beauchene flew into a tantrum, quite beside himself, and gasped:
      &ldquo;I a bad patriot! I, who kill myself with hard work! I, who even export
      French machinery!... Yes, certainly I see families, acquaintances around
      me who may well allow themselves four children; and I grant that they
      deserve censure when they have no families. But as for me, my dear doctor,
      it is impossible. You know very well that in my position I absolutely
      can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the hundredth time, he gave his reasons, relating how the works
      had narrowly escaped being cut into pieces, annihilated, simply because he
      had unfortunately been burdened with a sister. Seraphine had behaved
      abominably. There had been first her dowry; next her demands for the
      division of the property on their father&rsquo;s death; and the works had been
      saved only by means of a large pecuniary sacrifice which had long crippled
      their prosperity. And people imagined that he would be as imprudent as his
      father! Why, if Maurice should have a brother or a sister, he might
      hereafter find himself in the same dire embarrassment, in which the family
      property might already have been destroyed. No, no! He would not expose
      the boy to the necessity of dividing the inheritance in accordance with
      badly framed laws. He was resolved that Maurice should be the sole master
      of the fortune which he himself had derived from his father, and which he
      would transmit to his heir increased tenfold. For his son he dreamt of
      supreme wealth, a colossal fortune, such as nowadays alone ensures power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, refraining from any intervention, listened and remained grave;
      for this question of the birth-rate seemed to him a frightful one, the
      foremost of all questions, deciding the destiny of mankind and the world.
      There has never been any progress but such as has been determined by
      increase of births. If nations have accomplished evolutions, if
      civilization has advanced, it is because the nations have multiplied and
      subsequently spread through all the countries of the earth. And will not
      to-morrow&rsquo;s evolution, the advent of truth and justice, be brought about
      by the constant onslaught of the greater number, the revolutionary
      fruitfulness of the toilers and the poor?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite true that Mathieu did not plainly say all these things to
      himself; indeed, he felt slightly ashamed of the four children that he
      already had, and was disturbed by the counsels of prudence addressed to
      him by the Beauchenes. But within him there struggled his faith in life,
      his belief that the greatest possible sum of life must bring about the
      greatest sum of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, wishing to change the subject, he bethought himself of Marianne&rsquo;s
      commission, and at the first favorable opportunity exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, we
      shall rely on you, Marianne and I, for Sunday after next, at Janville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was still no answer, for just then a servant came to say that a
      woman with an infant in her arms desired to see Madame. And Beauchene,
      having recognized the wife of Moineaud, the fitter, bade her come in.
      Boutan, who had now risen, was prompted by curiosity to remain a little
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Moineaude, short and fat like her husband, was a woman of about forty,
      worn out before her time, with ashen face, pale eyes, thin faded hair, and
      a weak mouth which already lacked many teeth. A large family had been too
      much for her; and, moreover, she took no care of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good woman,&rdquo; Constance inquired, &ldquo;what do you wish with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But La Moineaude remained quite scared by the sight of all those people
      whom she had not expected to find there. She said nothing. She had hoped
      to speak to the lady privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your last-born?&rdquo; Beauchene asked her as he looked at the pale,
      puny child on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, it&rsquo;s my little Alfred; he&rsquo;s ten months old and I&rsquo;ve had to
      wean him, for I couldn&rsquo;t feed him any longer. I had nine others before
      this one, but three are dead. My eldest son, Eugene, is a soldier in
      Tonquin. You have my two big girls, Euphrasie and Norine, at the works.
      And I have three left at home&mdash;Victor, who is now fifteen, then
      Cecile and Irma, who are ten and seven. After Irma I thought I had done
      with children for good, and I was well pleased. But, you see, this urchin
      came! And I, forty too&mdash;it&rsquo;s not just! The good Lord must surely have
      abandoned us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dr. Boutan began to question her. He avoided looking at the
      Beauchenes, but there was a malicious twinkle in his little eyes, and it
      was evident that he took pleasure in recapitulating the employer&rsquo;s
      arguments against excessive prolificness. He pretended to get angry and to
      reproach the Moineauds for their ten wretched children&mdash;the boys
      fated to become food for powder, the girls always liable to misfortune.
      And he gave the woman to understand that it was her own fault if she was
      in distress; for people with a tribe of children about them could never
      become rich. And the poor creature sadly answered that he was quite right,
      but that no idea of becoming rich could ever have entered their heads.
      Moineaud knew well enough that he would never be a cabinet minister, and
      so it was all the same to them how many children they might have on their
      hands. Indeed, a number proved a help when the youngsters grew old enough
      to go out to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene had become silent and slowly paced the room. A slight chill, a
      feeling of uneasiness was springing up, and so Constance made haste to
      inquire: &ldquo;Well, my good woman, what is it I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, madame, it worries me; it&rsquo;s something which Moineaud
      didn&rsquo;t dare to ask of Monsieur Beauchene. For my part I hoped to find you
      alone and beg you to intercede for us. The fact is we should be very, very
      grateful if our little Victor could only be taken on at the works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is only fifteen,&rdquo; exclaimed Beauchene. &ldquo;You must wait till he&rsquo;s
      sixteen. The law is strict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. Only one might perhaps just tell a little fib. It would be
      rendering us such a service&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big tears welled into La Moineaude&rsquo;s eyes. And Mathieu, who had listened
      with passionate interest, felt quite upset. Ah! that wretched toil-doomed
      flesh that hastened to offer itself without waiting until it was even ripe
      for work! Ah! the laborer who is prepared to lie, whom hunger sets against
      the very law designed for his own protection!
    </p>
    <p>
      When La Moineaude had gone off in despair the doctor continued speaking of
      juvenile and female labor. As soon as a woman first finds herself a mother
      she can no longer continue toiling at a factory. Her lying-in and the
      nursing of her babe force her to remain at home, or else grievous
      infirmities may ensue for her and her offspring. As for the child, it
      becomes anemic, sometimes crippled; besides, it helps to keep wages down
      by being taken to work at a low scale of remuneration. Then the doctor
      went on to speak of the prolificness of wretchedness, the swarming of the
      lower classes. Was not the most hateful natality of all that which meant
      the endless increase of starvelings and social rebels?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly understand you,&rdquo; Beauchene ended by saying, without any show
      of anger, as he abruptly brought his perambulations to an end. &ldquo;You want
      to place me in contradiction with myself, and make me confess that I
      accept Moineaud&rsquo;s seven children and need them, whereas I, with my fixed
      determination to rest content with an only son, suppress, as it were, a
      family in order that I may not have to subdivide my estate. France, &lsquo;the
      country of only sons,&rsquo; as folks say nowadays&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, eh? But, my
      dear fellow, the question is so intricate, and at bottom I am altogether
      in the right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he wished to explain things, and clapped his hand to his breast,
      exclaiming that he was a liberal, a democrat, ready to demand all really
      progressive measures. He willingly recognized that children were
      necessary, that the army required soldiers, and the factories workmen.
      Only he also invoked the prudential duties of the higher classes, and
      reasoned after the fashion of a man of wealth, a conservative clinging to
      the fortune he has acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu meanwhile ended by understanding the brutal truth: Capital is
      compelled to favor the multiplication of lives foredoomed to wretchedness;
      in spite of everything it must stimulate the prolificness of the
      wage-earning classes, in order that its profits may continue. The law is
      that there must always be an excess of children in order that there may be
      enough cheap workers. Then also speculation on the wages&rsquo; ratio wrests all
      nobility from labor, which is regarded as the worst misfortune a man can
      be condemned to, when in reality it is the most precious of boons. Such,
      then, is the cancer preying upon mankind. In countries of political
      equality and economical inequality the capitalist regime, the faulty
      distribution of wealth, at once restrains and precipitates the birth-rate
      by perpetually increasing the wrongful apportionment of means. On one side
      are the rich folk with &ldquo;only&rdquo; sons, who continually increase their
      fortunes; on the other, the poor folk, who, by reason of their
      unrestrained prolificness, see the little they possess crumble yet more
      and more. If labor be honored to-morrow, if a just apportionment of wealth
      be arrived at, equilibrium will be restored. Otherwise social revolution
      lies at the end of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchene, in his triumphant manner, tried to show that he possessed
      great breadth of mind; he admitted the disquieting strides of a decrease
      of population, and denounced the causes of it&mdash;alcoholism,
      militarism, excessive mortality among infants, and other numerous matters.
      Then he indicated remedies; first, reductions in taxation, fiscal means in
      which he had little faith; then freedom to will one&rsquo;s estate as one
      pleased, which seemed to him more efficacious; a change, too, in the
      marriage laws, without forgetting the granting of affiliation rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Boutan ended by interrupting him. &ldquo;All the legislative measures
      in the world will do nothing,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Manners and customs, our
      notions of what is moral and what is not, our very conceptions of the
      beautiful in life&mdash;all must be changed. If France is becoming
      depopulated, it is because she so chooses. It is simply necessary then for
      her to choose so no longer. But what a task&mdash;a whole world to create
      anew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Mathieu raised a superb cry: &ldquo;Well! we&rsquo;ll create it. I&rsquo;ve begun
      well enough, surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Constance, after laughing in a constrained way, in her turn thought it
      as well to change the subject. And so she at last replied to his
      invitation, saying that she would do her best to go to Janville, though
      she feared she might not be able to dispose of a Sunday to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Boutan then took his leave, and was escorted to the door by Beauchene,
      who still went on jesting, like a man well pleased with life, one who was
      satisfied with himself and others, and who felt certain of being able to
      arrange things as might best suit his pleasure and his interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, a few minutes after midday, as Mathieu, who had been
      delayed in the works, went up to the offices to fetch Morange as he had
      promised to do, it occurred to him to take a short cut through the women&rsquo;s
      workshop. And there, in that spacious gallery, already deserted and
      silent, he came upon an unexpected scene which utterly amazed him. On some
      pretext or other Norine had lingered there the last, and Beauchene was
      with her, clasping her around the waist whilst he eagerly pressed his lips
      to hers. But all at once they caught sight of Mathieu and remained
      thunderstruck. And he, for his part, fled precipitately, deeply annoyed at
      having been a surprised witness to such a secret.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      MORANGE, the chief accountant at Beauchene&rsquo;s works, was a man of
      thirty-eight, bald and already gray-headed, but with a superb dark,
      fan-shaped beard, of which he was very proud. His full limpid eyes,
      straight nose, and well-shaped if somewhat large mouth had in his younger
      days given him the reputation of being a handsome fellow. He still took
      great care of himself, invariably wore a tall silk hat, and preserved the
      correct appearance of a very painstaking and well-bred clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know our new flat yet, do you?&rdquo; he asked Mathieu as he led him
      away. &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s perfect, as you will see. A bedroom for us and another for
      Reine. And it is so close to the works too. I get there in four minutes,
      watch in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, Morange, was the son of a petty commercial clerk who had died on his
      stool after forty years of cloistral office-life. And he had married a
      clerk&rsquo;s daughter, one Valerie Duchemin, the eldest of four girls whose
      parents&rsquo; home had been turned into a perfect hell, full of shameful
      wretchedness and unacknowledgable poverty, through this abominable
      incumbrance. Valerie, who was good-looking and ambitious, was lucky
      enough, however, to marry that handsome, honest, and hard-working fellow,
      Morange, although she was quite without a dowry; and, this accomplished,
      she indulged in the dream of climbing a little higher up the social
      ladder, and freeing herself from the loathsome world of petty clerkdom by
      making the son whom she hoped to have either an advocate or a doctor.
      Unfortunately the much-desired child proved to be a girl; and Valerie
      trembled, fearful of finding herself at last with four daughters on her
      hands, just as her mother had. Her dream thereupon changed, and she
      resolved to incite her husband onward to the highest posts, so that she
      might ultimately give her daughter a large dowry, and by this means gain
      that admittance to superior spheres which she so eagerly desired. Her
      husband, who was weak and extremely fond of her, ended by sharing her
      ambition, ever revolving schemes of pride and conquest for her benefit.
      But he had now been eight years at the Beauchene works, and he still
      earned but five thousand francs a year. This drove him and his wife to
      despair. Assuredly it was not at Beauchene&rsquo;s that he would ever make his
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after going a couple of hundred yards with
      Mathieu along the Boulevard de Grenelle, &ldquo;it is that new house yonder at
      the street corner. It has a stylish appearance, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu then perceived a lofty modern pile, ornamented with balconies and
      sculpture work, which looked quite out of place among the poor little
      houses predominating in the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is a palace!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in order to please Morange, who
      thereupon drew himself up quite proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see the staircase, my dear fellow! Our place, you know, is on
      the fifth floor. But that is of no consequence with such a staircase, so
      easy, so soft, that one climbs it almost without knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Morange showed his guest into the vestibule as if he were
      ushering him into a temple. The stucco walls gleamed brightly; there was a
      carpet on the stairs, and colored glass in the windows. And when, on
      reaching the fifth story, the cashier opened the door with his latchkey,
      he repeated, with an air of delight: &ldquo;You will see, you will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valerie and Reine must have been on the watch, for they hastened forward.
      At thirty-two Valerie was still young and charming. She was a
      pleasant-looking brunette, with a round smiling face in a setting of
      superb hair. She had a full, round bust, and admirable shoulders, of which
      her husband felt quite proud whenever she showed herself in a low-necked
      dress. Reine, at this time twelve years old, was the very portrait of her
      mother, showing much the same smiling, if rather longer, face under
      similar black tresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is very kind of you to accept our invitation,&rdquo; said Valerie gayly
      as she pressed both Mathieu&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;What a pity that Madame Froment
      could not come with you! Reine, why don&rsquo;t you relieve the gentleman of his
      hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she immediately continued: &ldquo;We have a nice light anteroom, you see.
      Would you like to glance over our flat while the eggs are being boiled?
      That will always be one thing done, and you will then at least know where
      you are lunching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was said in such an agreeable way, and Morange on his side smiled
      so good-naturedly, that Mathieu willingly lent himself to this innocent
      display of vanity. First came the parlor, the corner room, the walls of
      which were covered with pearl-gray paper with a design of golden flowers,
      while the furniture consisted of some of those white lacquered Louis XVI.
      pieces which makers turn out by the gross. The rosewood piano showed like
      a big black blot amidst all the rest. Then, overlooking the Boulevard de
      Grenelle, came Reine&rsquo;s bedroom, pale blue, with furniture of polished
      pine. Her parents&rsquo; room, a very small apartment, was at the other end of
      the flat, separated from the parlor by the dining-room. The hangings
      adorning it were yellow; and a bedstead, a washstand, and a wardrobe, all
      of thuya, had been crowded into it. Finally the classic &ldquo;old carved oak&rdquo;
       triumphed in the dining-room, where a heavily gilded hanging lamp flashed
      like fire above the table, dazzling in its whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s delightful,&rdquo; Mathieu, repeated, by way of politeness; &ldquo;why,
      it&rsquo;s a real gem of a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In their excitement, father, mother, and daughter never ceased leading him
      hither and thither, explaining matters to him and making him feel the
      things. He was most struck, by the circumstance that the place recalled
      something he had seen before; he seemed to be familiar with the
      arrangement of the drawing-room, and with the way in which the nicknacks
      in the bedchamber were set out. And all at once he remembered. Influenced
      by envy and covert admiration, the Moranges, despite themselves, no doubt,
      had tried to copy the Beauchenes. Always short of money as they were, they
      could only and by dint of great sacrifices indulge in a species of
      make-believe luxury. Nevertheless they were proud of it, and, by imitating
      the envied higher class from afar, they imagined that they drew nearer to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Morange exclaimed, as he opened the dining-room window, &ldquo;there
      is also this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, a balcony ran along the house-front, and at that height the view
      was really a very fine one, similar to that obtained from the Beauchene
      mansion but more extensive, the Seine showing in the distance, and the
      heights of Passy rising above the nearer and lower house-roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valerie also called attention to the prospect. &ldquo;It is magnificent, is it
      not?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;far better than the few trees that one can see from the
      quay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant was now bringing the boiled eggs and they took their seats at
      table, while Morange victoriously explained that the place altogether cost
      him sixteen hundred francs a year. It was cheap indeed, though the amount
      was a heavy charge on Morange&rsquo;s slender income. Mathieu now began to
      understand that he had been invited more particularly to admire the new
      flat, and these worthy people seemed so delighted to triumph over it
      before him that he took the matter gayly and without thought of spite.
      There was no calculating ambition in his nature; he envied nothing of the
      luxury he brushed against in other people&rsquo;s homes, and he was quite
      satisfied with the snug modest life he led with Marianne and his children.
      Thus he simply felt surprised at finding the Moranges so desirous of
      cutting a figure and making money, and looked at them with a somewhat sad
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valerie was wearing a pretty gown of foulard with a pattern of little
      yellow flowers, while her daughter, Reine, whom she liked to deck out
      coquettishly, had a frock of blue linen stuff. There was rather too much
      luxury about the meal also. Soles followed the eggs, and then came
      cutlets, and afterwards asparagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation began with some mention of Janville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so your children are in good health? Oh! they are very fine children
      indeed. And you really like the country? How funny! I think I should feel
      dreadfully bored there, for there is too great a lack of amusements. Why,
      yes, we shall be delighted to go to see you there, since Madame Froment is
      kind enough to invite us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as was bound to happen, the talk turned on the Beauchenes. This was
      a subject which haunted the Moranges, who lived in perpetual admiration of
      the Beauchenes, though at times they covertly criticised them. Valerie was
      very proud of being privileged to attend Constance&rsquo;s Saturday &ldquo;at-homes,&rdquo;
       and of having been twice invited to dinner by her during the previous
      winter. She on her side now had a day of her own, Tuesday, and she even
      gave little private parties, and half ruined herself in providing
      refreshments at them. As for her acquaintances, she spoke with profound
      respect of Mme. Seguin du Hordel and that lady&rsquo;s magnificent mansion in
      the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, for Constance had obligingly obtained her an
      invitation to a ball there. But she was particularly vain of the
      friendship of Beauchene&rsquo;s sister, Seraphine, whom she invariably called
      &ldquo;Madame la Baronne de Lowicz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness came to my at-home one afternoon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is so very
      good-natured and so gay! You knew her formerly, did you not? After her
      marriage, eh? when she became reconciled to her brother and their wretched
      disputes about money matters were over. By the way, she has no great
      liking for Madame Beauchene, as you must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she again reverted to the manufacturer&rsquo;s wife, declared that little
      Maurice, however sturdy he might look, was simply puffed out with bad
      flesh; and she remarked that it would be a terrible blow for the parents
      if they should lose that only son. The subject of children was thus
      started, and when Mathieu, laughing, observed that they, the Moranges, had
      but one child, the cashier protested that it was unfair to compare him
      with M. Beauchene, who was such a wealthy man. Valerie, for her part,
      pictured the position of her parents, afflicted with four daughters, who
      had been obliged to wait months and months for boots and frocks and hats,
      and had grown up anyhow, in perpetual terror lest they should never find
      husbands. A family was all very well, but when it happened to consist of
      daughters the situation became terrible for people of limited means; for
      if daughters were to be launched properly into life they must have
      dowries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am very ambitious for my husband, and I am
      convinced that he may rise to a very high position if he will only listen
      to me. But he must not be saddled with a lot of incumbrances. As things
      stand, I trust that we may be able to get rich and give Reine a suitable
      dowry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange, quite moved by this little speech, caught hold of his wife&rsquo;s hand
      and kissed it. Weak and good-natured as he was, Valerie was really the one
      with will. It was she who had instilled some ambition into him, and he
      esteemed her the more for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife is a thoroughly good woman, you know, my dear Froment,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;She has a good head as well as a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, while Valerie recapitulated her dream of wealth, the splendid flat
      she would have, the receptions she would hold, and the two months which,
      like the Beauchenes, she would spend at the seaside every summer, Mathieu
      looked at her and her husband and pondered their position. Their case was
      very different from that of old Moineaud, who knew that he would never be
      a cabinet minister. Morange possibly dreamt that his wife would indeed
      make him a minister some day. Every petty bourgeois in a democratic
      community has a chance of rising and wishes to do so. Indeed, there is a
      universal, ferocious rush, each seeking to push the others aside so that
      he may the more speedily climb a rung of the social ladder. This general
      ascent, this phenomenon akin to capillarity, is possible only in a country
      where political equality and economic inequality prevail; for each has the
      same right to fortune and has but to conquer it. There is, however, a
      struggle of the vilest egotism, if one wishes to taste the pleasures of
      the highly placed, pleasures which are displayed to the gaze of all and
      are eagerly coveted by nearly everybody in the lower spheres. Under a
      democratic constitution a nation cannot live happily if its manners and
      customs are not simple, and if the conditions of life are not virtually
      equal for one and all. Under other circumstances than these the liberal
      professions prove all-devouring: there is a rush for public functions;
      manual toil is regarded with contempt; luxury increases and becomes
      necessary; and wealth and power are furiously appropriated by assault in
      order that one may greedily taste the voluptuousness of enjoyment. And in
      such a state of affairs, children, as Valerie put it, were incumbrances,
      whereas one needed to be free, absolutely unburdened, if one wished to
      climb over all one&rsquo;s competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu also thought of that law of imitation which impels even the least
      fortunate to impoverish themselves by striving to copy the happy ones of
      the world. How great the distress which really lurks beneath that envied
      luxury that is copied at such great cost! All sorts of useless needs are
      created, and production is turned aside from the strictly necessary. One
      can no longer express hardship by saying that people lack bread; what they
      lack in the majority of cases is the superfluous, which they are unable to
      renounce without imagining that they have gone to the dogs and are in
      danger of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dessert, when the servant was no longer present, Morange, excited by
      his good meal, became expansive. Glancing at his wife he winked towards
      their guest, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, he&rsquo;s a safe friend; one may tell him everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when Valerie had consented with a smile and a nod, he went on: &ldquo;Well,
      this is the matter, my dear fellow: it is possible that I may soon leave
      the works. Oh! it&rsquo;s not decided, but I&rsquo;m thinking of it. Yes, I&rsquo;ve been
      thinking of it for some months past; for, when all is said, to earn five
      thousand francs a year, after eight years&rsquo; zeal, and to think that one
      will never earn much more, is enough to make one despair of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s monstrous,&rdquo; the young woman interrupted: &ldquo;it is like breaking one&rsquo;s
      head intentionally against a wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in such circumstances, my dear friend, the best course is to look
      out for something elsewhere, is it not? Do you remember Michaud, whom I
      had under my orders at the works some six years ago? A very intelligent
      fellow he was. Well, scarcely six years have elapsed since he left us to
      go to the Credit National, and what do you think he is now earning there?
      Twelve thousand francs&mdash;you hear me&mdash;twelve thousand francs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words rang out like a trumpet-call. The Moranges&rsquo; eyes dilated
      with ecstasy. Even the little girl became very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last March,&rdquo; continued Morange, &ldquo;I happened to meet Michaud, who told me
      all that, and showed himself very amiable. He offered to take me with him
      and help me on in my turn. Only there&rsquo;s some risk to run. He explained to
      me that I must at first accept three thousand six hundred, so as to rise
      gradually to a very big figure. But three thousand six hundred! How can
      one live on that in the meantime, especially now that this flat has
      increased our expenses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Valerie broke in impetuously: &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing venture, nothing have!&rsquo; 
      That&rsquo;s what I keep on repeating to him. Of course I am in favor of
      prudence; I would never let him do anything rash which might compromise
      his future. But, at the same time, he can&rsquo;t moulder away in a situation
      unworthy of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you have made up your minds?&rdquo; asked Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my wife has calculated everything,&rdquo; Morange replied; &ldquo;and, yes, we
      have made up our minds, provided, of course, that nothing unforeseen
      occurs. Besides, it is only in October that any situation will be open at
      the Credit National. But, I say, my dear friend, keep the matter entirely
      to yourself, for we don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with the Beauchenes just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked at his watch, for, like a good clerk, he was very punctual,
      and did not wish to be late at the office. The servant was hurried, the
      coffee was served, and they were drinking it, boiling hot as it was, when
      the arrival of a visitor upset the little household and caused everything
      to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Valerie, as she hastily rose, flushed with pride, &ldquo;Madame
      la Baronne de Lowicz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seraphine, at this time nine-and-twenty, was red-haired, tall and elegant,
      with magnificent shoulders which were known to all Paris. Her red lips
      were wreathed in a triumphant smile, and a voluptuous flame ever shone in
      her large brown eyes flecked with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t disturb yourselves, my friends,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your servant
      wanted to show me into the drawing-room, but I insisted on coming in here,
      because it is rather a pressing matter. I have come to fetch your charming
      little Reine to take her to a matinee at the Circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fresh explosion of delight ensued. The child remained speechless with
      joy, whilst the mother exulted and rattled on: &ldquo;Oh! Madame la Baronne, you
      are really too kind! You are spoiling the child. But the fact is that she
      isn&rsquo;t dressed, and you will have to wait a moment. Come, child, make
      haste, I will help you&mdash;ten minutes, you understand&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      keep you waiting a moment longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seraphine remained alone with the two men. She had made a gesture of
      surprise on perceiving Mathieu, whose hand, like an old friend, she now
      shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, are you quite well?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; he answered; and as she sat down near him he instinctively
      pushed his chair back. He did not seem at all pleased at having met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been on familiar terms with her during his earlier days at the
      Beauchene works. She was a frantic pleasure-lover, and destitute of both
      conscience and moral principles. Her conduct had given rise to scandal
      even before her extraordinary elopement with Baron de Lowicz, that needy
      adventurer with a face like an archangel&rsquo;s and the soul of a swindler. The
      result of the union was a stillborn child. Then Seraphine, who was
      extremely egotistical and avaricious, quarrelled with her husband and
      drove him away. He repaired to Berlin, and was killed there in a brawl at
      a gambling den. Delighted at being rid of him, Seraphine made every use of
      her liberty as a young widow. She figured at every fete, took part in
      every kind of amusement, and many scandalous stories were told of her; but
      she contrived to keep up appearances and was thus still received
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are living in the country, are you not?&rdquo; she asked again, turning
      towards Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have been there for three weeks past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance told me of it. I met her the other day at Madame Seguin&rsquo;s. We
      are on the best terms possible, you know, now that I give my brother good
      advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact her sister-in-law, Constance, hated her, but with her
      usual boldness she treated the matter as a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked about Dr. Gaude,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;I fancied that she wanted to
      ask for his address; but she did not dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Gaude!&rdquo; interrupted Morange. &ldquo;Ah! yes, a friend of my wife&rsquo;s spoke to
      her about him. He&rsquo;s a wonderfully clever man, it appears. Some of his
      operations are like miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on talking of Dr. Gaude&rsquo;s clinic at the Hopital Marbeuf, a
      clinic whither society folks hastened to see operations performed, just as
      they might go to a theatre. The doctor, who was fond of money, and who
      bled his wealthy lady patients in more senses than one, was likewise
      partial to glory and proud of accomplishing the most dangerous experiments
      on the unhappy creatures who fell into his hands. The newspapers were
      always talking about him, his cures were constantly puffed and advertised
      by way of inducing fine ladies to trust themselves to his skill. And he
      certainly accomplished wonders, cutting and carving his patients in the
      quietest, most unconcerned way possible, with never a scruple, never a
      doubt as to whether what he did was strictly right or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seraphine had begun to laugh, showing her white wolfish teeth between her
      blood-red lips, when she noticed the horrified expression which had
      appeared on Mathieu&rsquo;s face since Gaude had been spoken of. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she;
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man, now, who in nowise resembles your squeamish Dr. Boutan,
      who is always prattling about the birth-rate. I can&rsquo;t understand why
      Constance keeps to that old-fashioned booby, holding the views she does.
      She is quite right, you know, in her opinions. I fully share them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange laughed complaisantly. He wished to show her that his opinions
      were the same. However, as Valerie did not return with Reine, he grew
      impatient, and asked permission to go and see what they were about.
      Perhaps he himself might be able to help in getting the child ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Seraphine was alone with Mathieu she turned her big, ardent,
      gold-flecked eyes upon him. She no longer laughed with the same laugh as a
      moment previously; an expression of voluptuous irony appeared on her bold
      bad face. After a spell of silence she inquired, &ldquo;And is my good cousin
      Marianne quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; replied Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the children are still growing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, still growing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are happy, like a good paterfamilias, in your little nook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she lapsed into silence, but she did not cease to look at him, more
      provoking, more radiant than ever, with the charm of a young sorceress
      whose eyes burn and poison men&rsquo;s hearts. And at last she slowly resumed:
      &ldquo;And so it is all over between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture in token of assent. There had long since been a passing
      fancy between them. He had been nineteen at the time, and she
      two-and-twenty. He had then but just entered life, and she was already
      married. But a few months later he had fallen in love with Marianne, and
      had then entirely freed himself from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over&mdash;really?&rdquo; she again inquired, smiling but aggressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking very beautiful and bold, seeking to tempt him and carry
      him off from that silly little cousin of hers, whose tears would simply
      have made her laugh. And as Mathieu did not this time give her any answer,
      even by a wave of the hand, she went on: &ldquo;I prefer that: don&rsquo;t reply:
      don&rsquo;t say that it is all over. You might make a mistake, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes flashed, then he closed them in order that he
      might no longer see Seraphine, who was leaning towards him. It seemed as
      if all the past were coming back. She almost pressed her lips to his as
      she whispered that she still loved him; and when he drew back, full of
      mingled emotion and annoyance, she raised her little hand to his mouth as
      if she feared that he was again going to say no.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;they are coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Moranges were now indeed returning with Reine, whose hair had been
      curled. The child looked quite delicious in her frock of rose silk decked
      with white lace, and her large hat trimmed with some of the dress
      material. Her gay round face showed with flowery delicacy under the rose
      silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a love!&rdquo; exclaimed Seraphine by way of pleasing the parents.
      &ldquo;Somebody will be stealing her from me, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it occurred to her to kiss the child in passionate fashion, feigning
      the emotion of a woman who regrets that she is childless. &ldquo;Yes; indeed one
      regrets it very much when one sees such a treasure as this sweet girl of
      yours. Ah! if one could only be sure that God would give one such a
      charming child&mdash;well, at all events, I shall steal her from you; you
      need not expect me to bring her back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enraptured Moranges laughed delightedly. And Mathieu, who knew her
      well, listened in stupefaction. How many times during their short and
      passionate attachment had she not inveighed against children! In her
      estimation maternity poisoned love, aged woman, and made a horror of her
      in the eyes of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moranges accompanied her and Reine to the landing. And they could not
      find words warm enough to express their happiness at seeing such coveted
      wealth and luxury come to seek their daughter. When the door of the flat
      was closed Valerie darted on to the balcony, exclaiming, &ldquo;Let us see them
      drive off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange, who no longer gave a thought to the office, took up a position
      near her, and called Mathieu and compelled him likewise to lean over and
      look down. A well-appointed victoria was waiting below with a
      superb-looking coachman motionless on the box-seat. This sight put a
      finishing touch to the excitement of the Moranges. When Seraphine had
      installed the little girl beside her, they laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty she looks! How happy she must feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine must have been conscious that they were looking at her, for she
      raised her head, smiled and bowed. And Seraphine did the same, while the
      horse broke into a trot and turned the corner of the avenue. Then came a
      final explosion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at her!&rdquo; repeated Valerie; &ldquo;she is so candid! At twelve years old
      she is still as innocent as a child in her cradle. You know that I trust
      her to nobody. Wouldn&rsquo;t one think her a little duchess who has always had
      a carriage of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Morange reverted to his dream of fortune. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hope
      that she <i>will</i> have a carriage when we marry her off. Just let me
      get into the Credit National and you will see all your desires fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning towards Mathieu he added, &ldquo;There are three of us, and, as I
      have said before, that is quite enough for a man to provide for,
      especially as money is so hard to earn.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT the works during the afternoon Mathieu, who wished to be free earlier
      than usual in order that, before dining in town, he might call upon his
      landlord, in accordance with his promise to Marianne, found himself so
      busy that he scarcely caught sight of Beauchene. This was a relief, for
      the secret which he had discovered by chance annoyed him, and he feared
      lest he might cause his employer embarrassment. But the latter, when they
      exchanged a few passing words, did not seem to remember even that there
      was any cause for shame on his part. He had never before shown himself
      more active, more devoted to business. The fatigue he had felt in the
      morning had passed away, and he talked and laughed like one who finds life
      very pleasant, and has no fear whatever of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule Mathieu left at six o&rsquo;clock; but that day he went into Morange&rsquo;s
      office at half-past five to receive his month&rsquo;s salary. This rightly
      amounted to three hundred and fifty francs; but as five hundred had been
      advanced to him in January, which he paid back by instalments of fifty, he
      now received only fifteen louis, and these he pocketed with such an air of
      satisfaction that the accountant commented on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young fellow, &ldquo;the money&rsquo;s welcome, for I left my wife
      with just thirty sous this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was already more than six o&rsquo;clock when he found himself outside the
      superb house which the Seguin du Hordel family occupied in the Avenue
      d&rsquo;Antin. Seguin&rsquo;s grandfather had been a mere tiller of the soil at
      Janville. Later on, his father, as a contractor for the army, had made a
      considerable fortune. And he, son of a parvenu, led the life of a rich,
      elegant idler. He was a member of the leading clubs, and, while
      passionately fond of horses, affected also a taste for art and literature,
      going for fashion&rsquo;s sake to extreme opinions. He had proudly married an
      almost portionless girl of a very ancient aristocratic race, the last of
      the Vaugelades, whose blood was poor and whose mind was narrow. Her
      mother, an ardent Catholic, had only succeeded in making of her one who,
      while following religious practices, was eager for the joys of the world.
      Seguin, since his marriage, had likewise practised religion, because it
      was fashionable to do so. His peasant grandfather had had ten children;
      his father, the army contractor, had been content with six; and he himself
      had two, a boy and a girl, and deemed even that number more than was
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      One part of Seguin&rsquo;s fortune consisted of an estate of some twelve hundred
      acres&mdash;woods and heaths&mdash;above Janville, which his father had
      purchased with some of his large gains after retiring from business. The
      old man&rsquo;s long-caressed dream had been to return in triumph to his native
      village, whence he had started quite poor, and he was on the point of
      there building himself a princely residence in the midst of a vast park
      when death snatched him away. Almost the whole of this estate had come to
      Seguin in his share of the paternal inheritance, and he had turned the
      shooting rights to some account by dividing them into shares of five
      hundred francs value, which his friends eagerly purchased. The income
      derived from this source was, however, but a meagre one. Apart from the
      woods there was only uncultivated land on the estate, marshes, patches of
      sand, and fields of stones; and for centuries past the opinion of the
      district had been that no agriculturist could ever turn the expanse to
      good account. The defunct army contractor alone had been able to picture
      there a romantic park, such as he had dreamt of creating around his regal
      abode. It was he, by the way, who had obtained an authorization to add to
      the name of Seguin that of Du Hordel&mdash;taken from a ruined tower
      called the Hordel which stood on the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through Beauchene, one of the shareholders of the shooting rights,
      that Mathieu had made Seguin&rsquo;s acquaintance, and had discovered the old
      hunting-box, the lonely, quiet pavilion, which had pleased him so much
      that he had rented it. Valentine, who good-naturedly treated Marianne as a
      poor friend, had even been amiable enough to visit her there, and had
      declared the situation of the place to be quite poetical, laughing the
      while over her previous ignorance of it like one who had known nothing of
      her property. In reality she herself would not have lived there for an
      hour. Her husband had launched her into the feverish life of literary,
      artistic, and social Paris, hurrying her to gatherings, studios,
      exhibitions, theatres, and other pleasure resorts&mdash;all those
      brasier-like places where weak heads and wavering hearts are lost. He
      himself, amid all his passion for show, felt bored to death everywhere,
      and was at ease only among his horses; and this despite his pretensions
      with respect to advanced literature and philosophy, his collections of
      curios, such as the bourgeois of to-day does not yet understand, his
      furniture, his pottery, his pewter-work, and particularly his
      bookbindings, of which he was very proud. And he was turning his wife into
      a copy of himself, perverting her by his extravagant opinions and his
      promiscuous friendships, so that the little devotee who had been confided
      to his keeping was now on the high road to every kind of folly. She still
      went to mass and partook of the holy communion; but she was each day
      growing more and more familiar with wrong-doing. A disaster must surely be
      at the end of it all, particularly as he foolishly behaved to her in a
      rough, jeering way, which greatly hurt her feelings, and led her to dream
      of being loved with gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu entered the house, which displayed eight lofty windows on
      each of the stories of its ornate Renaissance facade, he laughed lightly
      as he thought: &ldquo;These folks don&rsquo;t have to wait for a monthly pittance of
      three hundred francs, with just thirty sous in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall was extremely rich, all bronze and marble. On the right hand were
      the dining-room and two drawing-rooms; on the left a billiard-room, a
      smoking-room, and a winter garden. On the first floor, in front of the
      broad staircase, was Seguin&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; a vast apartment,
      sixteen feet high, forty feet long, and six-and-twenty feet wide, which
      occupied all the central part of the house; while the husband&rsquo;s bed and
      dressing rooms were on the right, and those of the wife and children on
      the left hand. Up above, on the second floor, two complete suites of rooms
      were kept in reserve for the time when the children should have grown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman, who knew Mathieu, at once took him upstairs to the cabinet and
      begged him to wait there, while Monsieur finished dressing. For a moment
      the visitor fancied himself alone and glanced round the spacious room,
      feeling interested in its adornments, the lofty windows of old stained
      glass, the hangings of old Genoese velvet and brocaded silk, the oak
      bookcases showing the highly ornamented backs of the volumes they
      contained; the tables laden with bibelots, bronzes, marbles, goldsmith&rsquo;s
      work, glass work, and the famous collection of modern pewter-work. Then
      Eastern carpets were spread out upon all sides; there were low seats and
      couches for every mood of idleness, and cosy nooks in which one could hide
      oneself behind fringes of lofty plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! so it&rsquo;s you, Monsieur Froment,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed somebody in the
      direction of the table allotted to the pewter curios. And thereupon a tall
      young man of thirty, whom a screen had hitherto hidden from Mathieu&rsquo;s
      view, came forward with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mathieu, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;Monsieur Charles
      Santerre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was but their second meeting. They had found themselves together once
      before in that same room. Charles Santerre, already famous as a novelist,
      a young master popular in Parisian drawing-rooms, had a fine brow,
      caressing brown eyes, and a large red mouth which his moustache and beard,
      cut in the Assyrian style and carefully curled, helped to conceal. He had
      made his way, thanks to women, whose society he sought under pretext of
      studying them, but whom he was resolved to use as instruments of fortune.
      As a matter of calculation and principle he had remained a bachelor and
      generally installed himself in the nests of others. In literature feminine
      frailty was his stock subject he had made it his specialty to depict
      scenes of guilty love amid elegant, refined surroundings. At first he had
      no illusions as to the literary value of his works; he had simply chosen,
      in a deliberate way, what he deemed to be a pleasant and lucrative trade.
      But, duped by his successes, he had allowed pride to persuade him that he
      was really a writer. And nowadays he posed as the painter of an expiring
      society, professing the greatest pessimism, and basing a new religion on
      the annihilation of human passion, which annihilation would insure the
      final happiness of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seguin will be here in a moment,&rdquo; he resumed in an amiable way. &ldquo;It
      occurred to me to take him and his wife to dine at a restaurant this
      evening, before going to a certain first performance where there will
      probably be some fisticuffs and a rumpus to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu then for the first time noticed that Santerre was in evening
      dress. They continued chatting for a moment, and the novelist called
      attention to a new pewter treasure among Seguin&rsquo;s collection. It
      represented a long, thin woman, stretched full-length, with her hair
      streaming around her. She seemed to be sobbing as she lay there, and
      Santerre declared the conception to be a masterpiece. The figure
      symbolized the end of woman, reduced to despair and solitude when man
      should finally have made up his mind to have nothing further to do with
      her. It was the novelist who, in literary and artistic matters, helped on
      the insanity which was gradually springing up in the Seguins&rsquo; home.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Seguin himself now made his appearance. He was of the same age as
      Santerre, but was taller and slimmer, with fair hair, an aquiline nose,
      gray eyes, and thin lips shaded by a slight moustache. He also was in
      evening dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said he with the slight lisp which he
      affected, &ldquo;Valentine is determined to put on a new gown. So we must be
      patient; we shall have an hour to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on catching sight of Mathieu, he began to apologize, evincing much
      politeness and striving to accentuate his air of frigid distinction. When
      the young man, whom he called his amiable tenant, had acquainted him with
      the motive of his visit&mdash;the leak in the zinc roof of the little
      pavilion at Janville&mdash;he at once consented to let the local plumber
      do any necessary soldering. But when, after fresh explanations, he
      understood that the roofing was so worn and damaged that it required to be
      changed entirely, he suddenly departed from his lofty affability and began
      to protest, declaring that he could not possibly expend in such repairs a
      sum which would exceed the whole annual rental of six hundred francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some soldering,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;some soldering; it&rsquo;s understood. I will
      write to the plumber.&rdquo; And wishing to change the subject he added: &ldquo;Oh!
      wait a moment, Monsieur Froment. You are a man of taste, I know, and I
      want to show you a marvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He really had some esteem for Mathieu, for he knew that the young fellow
      possessed a quick appreciative mind. Mathieu began to smile, outwardly
      yielding to this attempt to create a diversion, but determined at heart
      that he would not leave the place until he had obtained the promise of a
      new roof. He took hold of a book, clad in a marvellous binding, which
      Seguin had fetched from a bookcase and tendered with religious care. On
      the cover of soft snow-white leather was incrusted a long silver lily,
      intersected by a tuft of big violet thistles. The title of the work,
      &ldquo;Beauty Imperishable,&rdquo; was engraved up above, as in a corner of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what a delightful conception, what delightful coloring!&rdquo; declared
      Mathieu, who was really charmed. &ldquo;Some bindings nowadays are perfect
      gems.&rdquo; Then he noticed the title: &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Monsieur Santerre&rsquo;s last
      novel!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seguin smiled and glanced at the writer, who had drawn near. And when he
      saw him examining the book and looking quite moved by the compliment paid
      to it, he exclaimed: &ldquo;My dear fellow, the binder brought it here this
      morning, and I was awaiting an opportunity to surprise you with it. It is
      the pearl of my collection! What do you think of the idea&mdash;that lily
      which symbolizes triumphant purity, and those thistles, the plants which
      spring up among ruins, and which symbolize the sterility of the world, at
      last deserted, again won over to the only perfect felicity? All your work
      lies in those symbols, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. But you spoil me; you will end by making me proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had read Santerre&rsquo;s novel, having borrowed a copy of it from Mme.
      Beauchene, in order that his wife might see it, since it was a book that
      everybody was talking of. And the perusal of it had exasperated him.
      Forsaking the customary bachelor&rsquo;s flat where in previous works he had
      been so fond of laying scenes of debauchery, Santerre had this time tried
      to rise to the level of pure art and lyrical symbolism. The story he told
      was one of a certain Countess Anne-Marie, who, to escape a rough-mannered
      husband of extreme masculinity, had sought a refuge in Brittany in the
      company of a young painter endowed with divine inspiration, one Norbert,
      who had undertaken to decorate a convent chapel with paintings that
      depicted his various visions. And for thirty years he went on painting
      there, ever in colloquy with the angels, and ever having Anne-Marie beside
      him. And during those thirty years of love the Countess&rsquo;s beauty remained
      unimpaired; she was as young and as fresh at the finish as at the outset;
      whereas certain secondary personages, introduced into the story, wives and
      mothers of a neighboring little town, sank into physical and mental decay,
      and monstrous decrepitude. Mathieu considered the author&rsquo;s theory that all
      physical beauty and moral nobility belonged to virgins only, to be
      thoroughly imbecile, and he could not restrain himself from hinting his
      disapproval of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Santerre and Seguin, however, hotly opposed him, and quite a
      discussion ensued. First Santerre took up the matter from a religious
      standpoint. Said he, the words of the Old Testament, &ldquo;Increase and
      multiply,&rdquo; were not to be found in the New Testament, which was the true
      basis of the Christian religion. The first Christians, he declared, had
      held marriage in horror, and with them the Holy Virgin had become the
      ideal of womanhood. Seguin thereupon nodded approval and proceeded to give
      his opinions on feminine beauty. But these were hardly to the taste of
      Mathieu, who promptly pointed out that the conception of beauty had often
      varied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you conceive beauty to consist in a long, slim,
      attenuated, almost angular figure; but at the time of the Renaissance the
      type of the beautiful was very different. Take Rubens, take Titian, take
      even Raffaelle, and you will see that their women were of robust build.
      Even their Virgin Marys have a motherly air. To my thinking, moreover, if
      we reverted to some such natural type of beauty, if women were not
      encouraged by fashion to compress and attenuate their figures so that
      their very nature, their very organism is changed, there would perhaps be
      some hope of coping with the evil of depopulation which is talked about so
      much nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others looked at him and smiled with an air of compassionate
      superiority. &ldquo;Depopulation an evil!&rdquo; exclaimed Seguin; &ldquo;can you, my dear
      sir, intelligent as you are, still believe in that hackneyed old story?
      Come, reflect and reason a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Santerre chimed in, and they went on talking one after the other and
      at times both together. Schopenhauer and Hartmann and Nietzsche were
      passed in review, and they claimed Malthus as one of themselves. But all
      this literary pessimism did not trouble Mathieu. He, with his belief in
      fruitfulness, remained convinced that the nation which no longer had faith
      in life must be dangerously ill. True, there were hours when he doubted
      the expediency of numerous families and asked himself if ten thousand
      happy people were not preferable to a hundred thousand unhappy ones; in
      which connection political and economic conditions had to be taken into
      account. But when all was said, he remained almost convinced that the
      Malthusian hypotheses would prove as false in the future as they had
      proved false in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even if the world should become densely populated,
      even if food supplies, such as we know them, should fall short, chemistry
      would extract other means of subsistence from inorganic matter. And,
      besides, all such eventualities are so far away that it is impossible to
      make any calculation on a basis of scientific certainty. In France, too,
      instead of contributing to any such danger, we are going backward, we are
      marching towards annihilation. The population of France was once a fourth
      of the population of Europe, but now it is only one-eighth. In a century
      or two Paris will be dead, like ancient Athens and ancient Rome, and we
      shall have fallen to the rank that Greece now occupies. Paris seems
      determined to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Santerre protested: &ldquo;No, no; Paris simply wishes to remain stationary,
      and it wishes this precisely because it is the most intelligent, most
      highly civilized city in the world. The more nations advance in
      civilization the smaller becomes their birth-rate. We are simply giving
      the world an example of high culture, superior intelligence, and other
      nations will certainly follow that example when in turn they also attain
      to our state of perfection. There are signs of this already on every
      side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; exclaimed Seguin, backing up his friend. &ldquo;The phenomenon is
      general; all the nations show the same symptoms, and are decreasing in
      numbers, or will decrease as soon as they become civilized. Japan is
      affected already, and the same will be the case with China as soon as
      Europe forces open the door there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had become grave and attentive since the two society men, seated
      before him in evening dress, had begun to talk more rationally. The pale,
      slim, flat virgin, their ideal of feminine beauty, was no longer in
      question. The history of mankind was passing by. And almost as if
      communing with himself, he said: &ldquo;So you do not fear the Yellow Peril,
      that terrible swarming of Asiatic barbarians who, it was said, would at
      some fatal moment sweep down on our Europe, ravage it, and people it
      afresh? In past ages, history always began anew in that fashion, by the
      sudden shifting of oceans, the invasion of fierce rough races coming to
      endow weakened nations with new blood. And after each such occurrence
      civilization flowered afresh, more broadly and freely than ever. How was
      it that Babylon, Nineveh, and Memphis fell into dust with their
      populations, who seem to have died on the spot? How is it that Athens and
      Rome still agonize to-day, unable to spring afresh from their ashes and
      renew the splendor of their ancient glory? How is it that death has
      already laid its hand upon Paris, which, whatever her splendor, is but the
      capital of a France whose virility is weakened? You may argue as you
      please and say that, like the ancient capitals of the world, Paris is
      dying of an excess of culture, intelligence, and civilization; it is none
      the less a fact that she is approaching death, the turn of the tide which
      will carry splendor and power to some new nation. Your theory of
      equilibrium is wrong. Nothing can remain stationary; whatever ceases to
      grow, decreases and disappears. And if Paris is bent on dying, she will
      die, and the country with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; declared Santerre, resuming the pose of an elegant
      pessimist, &ldquo;if she wishes to die, I shan&rsquo;t oppose her. In fact, I&rsquo;m fully
      determined to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident that the really honest, sensible course is to check any
      increase of population,&rdquo; added Seguin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu, as if he had not heard them, went on: &ldquo;I know Herbert
      Spencer&rsquo;s law, and I believe it to be theoretically correct. It is certain
      that civilization is a check to fruitfulness, so that one may picture a
      series of social evolutions conducing now to decrease and now to increase
      of population, the whole ending in final equilibrium, by the very effect
      of culture&rsquo;s victory when the world shall be entirely populated and
      civilized. But who can foretell what road will be followed, through what
      disasters and sufferings one may have to go? More and more nations may
      disappear, and others may replace them; and how many thousands of years
      may not be needed before the final adjustment, compounded of truth,
      justice, and peace, is arrived at? At the thought of this the mind
      trembles and hesitates, and the heart contracts with a pang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deep silence fell while he thus remained disturbed, shaken in his faith in
      the good powers of life, and at a loss as to who was right&mdash;he or
      those two men so languidly stretched out before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Valentine, Seguin&rsquo;s wife, came in, laughing and making an exhibition
      of masculine ways, which it had cost her much trouble to acquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you people; you must not bear me any malice, you know. That girl
      Celeste takes such a time over everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five-and-twenty Valentine was short, slight, and still girlish. Fair,
      with a delicate face, laughing blue eyes, and a pert little nose, she
      could not claim to be pretty. Still she was charming and droll, and very
      free and easy in her ways; for not only did her husband take her about
      with him to all sorts of objectionable places, but she had become quite
      familiar with the artists and writers who frequented the house. Thus it
      was only in the presence of something extremely insulting that she again
      showed herself the last of the Vaugelades, and would all at once draw
      herself up and display haughty contempt and frigidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, Monsieur Froment,&rdquo; she said amiably, stepping towards
      Mathieu and shaking his hand in cavalier fashion. &ldquo;Is Madame Froment in
      good health? Are the children flourishing as usual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seguin was examining her dress, a gown of white silk trimmed with
      unbleached lace, and he suddenly gave way to one of those horribly rude
      fits which burst forth at times amid all his great affectation of
      politeness. &ldquo;What! have you kept us waiting all this time to put that rag
      on? Well, you never looked a greater fright in your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she had entered the room convinced that she looked charming! She made
      an effort to control herself, but her girlish face darkened and assumed an
      expression of haughty, vindictive revolt. Then she slowly turned her eyes
      towards the friend who was present, and who was gazing at her with
      ecstasy, striving to accentuate the slavish submissiveness of his
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look delicious!&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;that gown is a marvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seguin laughed and twitted Santerre on his obsequiousness towards women.
      Valentine, mollified by the compliment, soon recovered her birdlike
      gayety, and such free and easy conversation ensued between the trio that
      Mathieu felt both stupefied and embarrassed. In fact, he would have gone
      off at once had it not been for his desire to obtain from his landlord a
      promise to repair the pavilion properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait another moment,&rdquo; Valentine at last said to her husband; &ldquo;I told
      Celeste to bring the children, so that we might kiss them before
      starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu wished to profit by this fresh delay, and sought to renew his
      request; but Valentine was already rattling on again, talking of dining at
      the most disreputable restaurant possible, and asking if at the first
      performance which they were to attend they would see all the horrors which
      had been hissed at the dress rehearsal the night before. She appeared like
      a pupil of the two men between whom she stood. She even went further in
      her opinions than they did, displaying the wildest pessimism, and such
      extreme views on literature and art that they themselves could not forbear
      laughing. Wagner was greatly over-estimated, in her opinion; she asked for
      invertebrate music, the free harmony of the passing wind. As for her moral
      views, they were enough to make one shudder. She had got past the
      argumentative amours of Ibsen&rsquo;s idiotic, rebellious heroines, and had now
      reached the theory of pure intangible beauty. She deemed Santerre&rsquo;s last
      creation, Anne-Marie, to be far too material and degraded, because in one
      deplorable passage the author remarked that Norbert&rsquo;s kisses had left
      their trace on the Countess&rsquo;s brow. Santerre disputed the quotation,
      whereupon she rushed upon the volume and sought the page to which she had
      referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never degraded her,&rdquo; exclaimed the novelist in despair. &ldquo;She never
      has a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! What of that?&rdquo; exclaimed Valentine. &ldquo;If Anne-Marie is to raise our
      hearts she ought to be like spotless marble, and Norbert&rsquo;s kisses should
      leave no mark upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was interrupted, for Celeste, the maid, a tall dark girl with an
      equine head, big features, and a pleasant air, now came in with the two
      children. Gaston was at this time five years old, and Lucie was three.
      Both were slight and delicate, pale like roses blooming in the shade. Like
      their mother, they were fair. The lad&rsquo;s hair was inclined to be carroty,
      while that of the girl suggested the color of oats. And they also had
      their mother&rsquo;s blue eyes, but their faces were elongated like that of
      their father. Dressed in white, with their locks curled, arrayed indeed in
      the most coquettish style, they looked like big fragile dolls. The parents
      were touched in their worldly pride at sight of them, and insisted on
      their playing their parts with due propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you wish anybody good evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children were not timid; they were already used to society and looked
      visitors full in the face. If they made little haste, it was because they
      were naturally indolent and did not care to obey. They at last made up
      their minds and allowed themselves to be kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, good friend Santerre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they hesitated before Mathieu, and their father had to remind them of
      the gentleman&rsquo;s name, though they had already seen him on two or three
      occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Monsieur Froment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine took hold of them, sat them on her lap, and half stifled them
      with caresses. She seemed to adore them, but as soon as she had sat them
      down again she forgot all about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going out again, mamma?&rdquo; asked the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, my darling. Papas and mammas, you know, have their affairs to
      see to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we shall have dinner all alone, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine did not answer, but turned towards the maid, who was waiting for
      orders;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to leave them for a moment, Celeste&mdash;you hear? And,
      above all things, they are not to go into the kitchen. I can never come
      home without finding them in the kitchen. It is exasperating. Let them
      have their dinner at seven, and put them to bed at nine. And see that they
      go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big girl with the equine head listened with an air of respectful
      obedience, while her faint smile expressed the cunning of a Norman peasant
      who had been five years in Paris already and was hardened to service, and
      well knew what was done with children when the master and mistress were
      absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she said in a simple way, &ldquo;Mademoiselle Lucie is poorly. She has
      been sick again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? sick again!&rdquo; cried the father in a fury. &ldquo;I am always hearing of
      that! They are always being sick! And it always happens when we are going
      out! It is very disagreeable, my dear; you might see to it; you ought not
      to let our children have papier-mache stomachs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother made an angry gesture, as if to say that she could not help it.
      As a matter of fact, the children were often poorly. They had experienced
      every childish ailment, they were always catching cold or getting
      feverish. And they preserved the mute, moody, and somewhat anxious
      demeanor of children who are abandoned to the care of servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true you were poorly, my little Lucie?&rdquo; asked Valentine, stooping
      down to the child. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t poorly now, are you? No, no, it&rsquo;s nothing,
      nothing at all. Kiss me, my pet; bid papa good night very prettily, so
      that he may not feel worried in leaving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose up, already tranquillized and gay again; and, noticing that
      Mathieu was looking at her, she exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! these little folks give one a deal of worry. But one loves them
      dearly all the same, though, so far as there is happiness in life, it
      would perhaps be better for them never to have been born. However, my duty
      to the country is done. Each wife ought to have a boy and a girl as I
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Mathieu, seeing that she was jesting, ventured to say with a
      laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that isn&rsquo;t the opinion of your medical man, Dr. Boutan. He declares
      that to make the country prosperous every married couple ought to have
      four children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four children! He&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; cried Seguin. And again with the greatest
      freedom of language he brought forward his pet theories. There was a world
      of meaning in his wife&rsquo;s laughter while Celeste stood there unmoved and
      the children listened without understanding. But at last Santerre led the
      Seguins away. It was only in the hall that Mathieu obtained from his
      landlord a promise that he would write to the plumber at Janville and that
      the roof of the pavilion should be entirely renovated, since the rain came
      into the bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seguins&rsquo; landau was waiting at the door. When they had got into it
      with their friend, it occurred to Mathieu to raise his eyes; and at one of
      the windows he perceived Celeste standing between the two children,
      intent, no doubt, on assuring herself that Monsieur and Madame were really
      going. The young man recalled Reine&rsquo;s departure from her parents; but here
      both Lucie and Gaston remained motionless, gravely mournful, and neither
      their father nor their mother once thought of looking up at them.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT half-past seven o&rsquo;clock, when Mathieu arrived at the restaurant on the
      Place de la Madeleine where he was to meet his employer, he found him
      already there, drinking a glass of madeira with his customer, M.
      Firon-Badinier. The dinner was a remarkable one; choice viands and the
      best wines were served in abundance. But Mathieu was struck less by the
      appetite which the others displayed than by Beauchene&rsquo;s activity and
      skill. Glass in hand, never losing a bite, he had already persuaded his
      customer, by the time the roast arrived, to order not only the new
      thresher but also a mowing machine. M. Firon-Badinier was to take the
      train for Evreux at nine-twenty, and when nine o&rsquo;clock struck, the other,
      now eager to be rid of him, contrived to pack him off in a cab to the
      St.-Lazare railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Beauchene remained standing on the pavement with Mathieu, and
      took off his hat in order that the mild breezes of that delightful May
      evening might cool his burning head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t so easily
      managed. It was the Pommard which induced the beggar to make up his mind.
      All the same, I was dreadfully afraid he would make me miss my
      appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks, which escaped him amid his semi-intoxication, led him to
      more confidential talk. He put on his hat again, lighted a fresh cigar,
      and took Mathieu&rsquo;s arm. Then they walked on slowly through the
      passion-stirred throng and the nightly blaze of the Boulevards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time,&rdquo; said Beauchene. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expected till half-past
      nine, and it&rsquo;s close by. Will you have a cigar? No? You never smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, it would be ridiculous to feign with you, since you
      happened to see me this morning. Oh, it&rsquo;s a stupid affair! I&rsquo;m quite of
      that opinion; but, then, what would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he launched out into long explanations concerning his marital
      life and the intrigue which had suddenly sprung up between him and that
      girl Norine, old Moineaud&rsquo;s daughter. He professed the greatest respect
      for his wife, but he was nevertheless a loose liver; and Constance was now
      beginning to resign herself to the inevitable. She closed her eyes when it
      would have been unpleasant for her to keep them open. She knew very well
      that it was essential that the business should be kept together and pass
      intact into the hands of their son Maurice. A tribe of children would have
      meant the ruin of all their plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu listened at first in great astonishment, and then began to ask
      questions and raise objections, at most of which Beauchene laughed gayly,
      like the gross egotist he was. He talked at length with extreme
      volubility, going into all sorts of details, at times assuming a
      semi-apologetic manner, but more frequently justifying himself with an air
      of triumph. And, finally, when they reached the corner of the Rue
      Caumartin he halted to bid Mathieu good-by. He there had a little
      bachelor&rsquo;s lodging, which was kept in order by the concierge of the house,
      who, being very well paid, proved an extremely discreet domestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he hurried off, Mathieu, still standing at the corner of the street,
      could not help thinking of the scenes which he had witnessed at the
      Beauchene works that day. He thought of old Moineaud, the fitter, whom he
      again saw standing silent and unmoved in the women&rsquo;s workroom while his
      daughter Euphrasie was being soundly rated by Beauchene, and while Norine,
      the other girl, looked on with a sly laugh. When the toiler&rsquo;s children
      have grown up and gone to join, the lads the army of slaughter, and the
      girls the army of vice, the father, degraded by the ills of life, pays
      little heed to it all. To him it is seemingly a matter of indifference to
      what disaster the wind may carry the fledgelings who fall from the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, and Mathieu had more than an hour
      before him to reach the Northern railway station. So he did not hurry, but
      strolled very leisurely up the Boulevards. He had eaten and drunk far more
      than usual, and Beauchene&rsquo;s insidious confidential talk, still buzzing in
      his ears, helped on his intoxication. His hands were hot, and now and
      again a sudden glow passed over his face. And what a warm evening it was,
      too, on those Boulevards, blazing with electric lights, fevered by a
      swarming, jostling throng, amid a ceaseless rumble of cabs and omnibuses!
      It was all like a stream of ardent life flowing away into the night, and
      Mathieu allowed himself to be carried on by the torrent, whose hot breath,
      whose glow of passion, he ever felt sweeping over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a reverie, he pictured the day he had just spent. First he was at
      the Beauchenes&rsquo; in the morning, and saw the father and mother standing,
      like accomplices who fully shared one another&rsquo;s views, beside the sofa on
      which Maurice, their only son, lay dozing with a pale and waxen face. The
      works must never be exposed to the danger of being subdivided. Maurice
      alone must inherit all the millions which the business might yield, so
      that he might become one of the princes of industry. And therefore the
      husband hurried off to sin while the wife closed her eyes. In this sense,
      in defiance of morality and health, did the capitalist bourgeoisie, which
      had replaced the old nobility, virtually re-establish the law of
      primogeniture. That law had been abolished at the Revolution for the
      bourgeoisie&rsquo;s benefit; but now, also for its own purposes, it revived it.
      Each family must have but one son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had reached this stage in his reflections when his thoughts were
      diverted by several street hawkers who, in selling the last edition of an
      evening print, announced a &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; of the lottery stock of some
      enterprise launched by the Credit National. And then he suddenly recalled
      the Moranges in their dining-room, and heard them recapitulate their dream
      of making a big fortune as soon as the accountant should have secured a
      post in one of the big banking establishments, where the principals raise
      men of value to the highest posts. Those Moranges lived in everlasting
      dread of seeing their daughter marry a needy petty clerk; succumbing to
      that irresistible fever which, in a democracy ravaged by political
      equality and economic inequality, impels every one to climb higher up the
      social ladder. Envy consumed them at the thought of the luxury of others;
      they plunged into debt in order that they might imitate from afar the
      elegance of the upper class, and all their natural honesty and good nature
      was poisoned by the insanity born of ambitious pride. And here again but
      one child was permissible, lest they should be embarrassed, delayed,
      forever impeded in the attainment of the future they coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of people now barred Mathieu&rsquo;s way, and he perceived that he was
      near the theatre, where a first performance was taking place that evening.
      It was a theatre where free farcical pieces were produced, and on its
      walls were posted huge portraits of its &ldquo;star,&rdquo; a carroty wench with a
      long flat figure, destitute of all womanliness, and seemingly symbolical
      of perversity. Passers-by stopped to gaze at the bills, the vilest remarks
      were heard, and Mathieu remembered that the Seguins and Santerre were
      inside the house, laughing at the piece, which was of so filthy a nature
      that the spectators at the dress rehearsal, though they were by no means
      over-nice in such matters, had expressed their disgust by almost wrecking
      the auditorium. And while the Seguins were gloating over this horror,
      yonder, at their house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, Celeste had just put the
      children, Gaston and Lucie, to bed, and had then hastily returned to the
      kitchen, where a friend, Madame Menoux, who kept a little haberdasher&rsquo;s
      shop in the neighborhood, awaited her. Gaston, having been given some wine
      to drink, was already asleep; but Lucie, who again felt sick, lay
      shivering in her bed, not daring to call Celeste, lest the servant, who
      did not like to be disturbed, should ill-treat her. And, at two o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning, after offering Santerre an oyster supper at a night
      restaurant, the Seguins would come home, their minds unhinged by the
      imbecile literature and art to which they had taken for fashion&rsquo;s sake,
      vitiated yet more by the ignoble performance they had witnessed, and the
      base society they had elbowed at supper. They seemed to typify vice for
      vice&rsquo;s sake, elegant vice and pessimism as a principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, when Mathieu tried to sum up his day, he found vice on every side,
      in each of the spheres with which he had come in contact. And now the
      examples he had witnessed filled him no longer with mere surprise; they
      disturbed him, they shook his beliefs, they made him doubt whether his
      notions of life, duty, and happiness might not after all be inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short and drew a long breath, seeking to drive away his growing
      intoxication. He had passed the Grand Opera and was reaching the crossway
      of the Rue Drouot. Perhaps his increase of fever was due to those glowing
      Boulevards. The private rooms of the restaurants were still ablaze, the
      cafes threw bright radiance across the road, the pavement was blocked by
      their tables and chairs and customers. All Paris seemed to have come down
      thither to enjoy that delightful evening. There was endless elbowing,
      endless mingling of breath as the swelling crowd sauntered along. Couples
      lingered before the sparkling displays of jewellers&rsquo; shops. Middle-class
      families swept under dazzling arches of electric lamps into cafes
      concerts, whose huge posters promised the grossest amusements. Hundreds
      and hundreds of women went by with trailing skirts, and whispered and
      jested and laughed; while men darted in pursuit, now of a fair chignon,
      now of a dark one. In the open cabs men and women sat side by side, now
      husbands and wives long since married, now chance couples who had met but
      an hour ago. But Mathieu went on again, yielding to the force of the
      current, carried along like all the others, a prey to the same fever which
      sprang from the surroundings, from the excitement of the day, from the
      customs of the age. And he no longer took the Beauchenes, the Moranges,
      the Seguins as isolated types; it was all Paris that symbolized vice, all
      Paris that yielded to debauchery and sank into degradation. There were the
      folks of high culture, the folks suffering from literary neurosis; there
      were the merchant princes; there were the men of liberal professions, the
      lawyers, the doctors, the engineers; there were the people of the lower
      middle-class, the petty tradesmen, the petty clerks; there were even the
      manual workers, poisoned by the example of the upper spheres&mdash;all
      practising the doctrines of egotism as vanity and the passion for money
      grew more and more intense.. .. No more children! Paris was bent on dying.
      And Mathieu recalled how Napoleon I., one evening after battle, on
      beholding a plain strewn with the corpses of his soldiers, had put his
      trust in Paris to repair the carnage of that day. But times had changed.
      Paris would no longer supply life, whether it were for slaughter or for
      toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Mathieu thought of it all a sudden weakness came upon him. Again he
      asked himself whether the Beauchenes, the Moranges, the Seguins, and all
      those thousands and thousands around him were not right, and whether he
      were not the fool, the dupe, the criminal, with his belief in life ever
      renascent, ever growing and spreading throughout the world. And before him
      arose, too, the image of Seraphine, the temptress, opening her perfumed
      arms to him and carrying him off to the same existence of pleasure and
      baseness which the others led.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembered the three hundred francs which he carried in his
      pocket. Three hundred francs, which must last for a whole month, though
      out of them he had to pay various little sums that he already owed. The
      remainder would barely suffice to buy a ribbon for Marianne and jam for
      the youngsters&rsquo; bread. And if he set the Moranges on one side, the others,
      the Beauchenes and the Seguins, were rich. He bitterly recalled their
      wealth. He pictured the rumbling factory with its black buildings covering
      a great stretch of ground; he pictured hundreds of workmen ever increasing
      the fortune of their master, who dwelt in a handsomely appointed pavilion
      and whose only son was growing up for future sovereignty, under his
      mother&rsquo;s vigilant eyes. He pictured, too, the Seguins&rsquo; luxurious mansion
      in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, the great hall, the magnificent staircase, the vast
      room above, crowded with marvels; he pictured all the refinement, all the
      train of wealth, all the tokens of lavish life, the big dowry which would
      be given to the little girl, the high position which would be purchased
      for the son. And he, bare and empty-handed, who now possessed nothing, not
      even a stone at the edge of a field, would doubtless always possess
      nothing, neither factory buzzing with workmen, nor mansion rearing its
      proud front aloft. And he was the imprudent one, and the others were the
      sensible, the wise. What would ever become of himself and his troop of
      children? Would he not die in some garret? would they not lead lives of
      abject wretchedness? Ah! it was evident the others were right, the others
      were sensible. And he felt unhinged, he regarded himself with contempt,
      like a fool who has allowed himself to be duped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then once more the image of Seraphine arose before his eyes, more tempting
      than ever. A slight quiver came upon him as he beheld the blaze of the
      Northern railway station and all the feverish traffic around it. Wild
      fancies surged through his brain. He thought of Beauchene. Why should he
      not do likewise? He recalled past times, and, yielding to sudden madness,
      turned his back upon the station and retraced his steps towards the
      Boulevards. Seraphine, he said to himself, was doubtless waiting for him;
      she had told him that he would always be welcome. As for his wife, he
      would tell her he had missed his train.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a block in the traffic made him pause, and on raising his eyes he
      saw that he had reached the Boulevards once more. The crowd still streamed
      along, but with increased feverishness. Mathieu&rsquo;s temples were beating,
      and wild words escaped his lips. Why should he not live the same life as
      the others? He was ready, even eager, to plunge into it. But the block in
      the traffic continued, he could not cross the road; and while he stood
      there hesitation and doubt came upon him. He saw in that increasing
      obstruction a deliberate obstacle to his wild design. And all at once the
      image of Seraphine faded from before his mind&rsquo;s eye and he beheld another,
      his wife, his dear wife Marianne, awaiting him, all smiles and
      trustfulness, in the fresh quietude of the country. Could he deceive her?
      ... Then all at once he again rushed off towards the railway station, in
      fear lest he should lose his train. He was determined that he would listen
      to no further promptings, that he would cast no further glance upon
      glowing, dissolute Paris, and he reached the station just in time to climb
      into a car. The train started and he journeyed on, leaning out of his
      compartment and offering his face to the cool night breeze in order that
      it might calm and carry off the evil fever that had possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was moonless, but studded with such pure and such glowing stars
      that the country could be seen spreading far away beneath a soft bluish
      radiance. Already at twenty minutes past eleven Marianne found herself on
      the little bridge crossing the Yeuse, midway between Chantebled, the
      pavilion where she and her husband lived, and the station of Janville. The
      children were fast asleep; she had left them in the charge of Zoe, the
      servant, who sat knitting beside a lamp, the light of which could be seen
      from afar, showing like a bright spark amid the black line of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Mathieu returned home by the seven o&rsquo;clock train, as was his
      wont, Marianne came to meet him at the bridge. Occasionally she brought
      her two eldest boys, the twins, with her, though their little legs moved
      but slowly on the return journey when, in retracing their steps, a
      thousand yards or more, they had to climb a rather steep hillside. And
      that evening, late though the hour was, Marianne had yielded to that
      pleasant habit of hers, enjoying the delight of thus going forward through
      the lovely night to meet the man she worshipped. She never went further
      than the bridge which arched over the narrow river. She seated herself on
      its broad, low parapet, as on some rustic bench, and thence she overlooked
      the whole plain as far as the houses of Janville, before which passed the
      railway line. And from afar she could see her husband approaching along
      the road which wound between the cornfields.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she took her usual seat under the broad velvety sky spangled
      with gold. And with a movement which bespoke her solicitude she turned
      towards the bright little light shining on the verge of the sombre woods,
      a light telling of the quietude of the room in which it burnt, the
      servant&rsquo;s tranquil vigil, and the happy slumber of the children in the
      adjoining chamber. Then Marianne let her gaze wander all around her, over
      the great estate of Chantebled, belonging to the Seguins. The dilapidated
      pavilion stood at the extreme edge of the woods whose copses, intersected
      by patches of heath, spread over a lofty plateau to the distant farms of
      Mareuil and Lillebonne. But that was not all, for to the west of the
      plateau lay more than two hundred and fifty acres of land, a marshy
      expanse where pools stagnated amid brushwood, vast uncultivated tracts,
      where one went duck-shooting in winter. And there was yet a third part of
      the estate, acres upon acres of equally sterile soil, all sand and gravel,
      descending in a gentle slope to the embankment of the railway line. It was
      indeed a stretch of country lost to culture, where the few good patches of
      loam remained unproductive, inclosed within the waste land. But the spot
      had all the beauty and exquisite wildness of solitude, and was one that
      appealed to healthy minds fond of seeing nature in freedom. And on that
      lovely night one could nowhere have found more perfect and more balmy
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, who since coming to the district had already threaded the
      woodland paths, explored the stretches of brushwood around the meres, and
      descended the pebbly slopes, let her eyes travel slowly over the expanse,
      divining spots she had visited and was fond of, though the darkness now
      prevented her from seeing them. In the depths of the woods an owl raised
      its soft, regular cry, while from a pond on the right ascended a faint
      croaking of frogs, so far away that it sounded like the vibration of
      crystal. And from the other side, the side of Paris, there came a growing
      rumble which, little by little, rose above all the other sounds of the
      night. She heard it, and at last lent ear to nothing else. It was the
      train, for whose familiar roar she waited every evening. As soon as it
      left Monval station on its way to Janville, it gave token of its coming,
      but so faintly that only a practised ear could distinguish its rumble amid
      the other sounds rising from the country side. For her part, she heard it
      immediately, and thereupon followed it in fancy through every phase of its
      journey. And never had she been better able to do so than on that splendid
      night, amid the profound quietude of the earth&rsquo;s slumber. It had left
      Monval, it was turning beside the brickworks, it was skirting St. George&rsquo;s
      fields. In another two minutes it would be at Janville. Then all at once
      its white light shone out beyond the poplar trees of Le Mesnil Rouge, and
      the panting of the engine grew louder, like that of some giant racer
      drawing near. On that side the plain spread far away into a dark, unknown
      region, beneath the star-spangled sky, which on the very horizon showed a
      ruddy reflection like that of some brasier, the reflection of nocturnal
      Paris, blazing and smoking in the darkness like a volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne sprang to her feet. The train stopped at Janville, and then its
      rumble rose again, grew fainter, and died away in the direction of
      Vieux-Bourg. But she no longer paid attention to it. She now had eyes and
      ears only for the road which wound like a pale ribbon between the dark
      patches of corn. Her husband did not take ten minutes to cover the
      thousand yards and more which separated the station from the little
      bridge. And, as a rule, she perceived and recognized him far off; but on
      that particular night, such was the deep silence that she could
      distinguish his footfall on the echoing road long before his dark, slim
      figure showed against the pale ground. And he found her there, erect under
      the stars, smiling and healthy, a picture of all that is good. The milky
      whiteness of her skin was accentuated by her beautiful black hair, caught
      up in a huge coil, and her big black eyes, which beamed with all the
      gentleness of spouse and mother. Her straight brow, her nose, her mouth,
      her chin so boldly, purely rounded, her cheeks which glowed like savory
      fruit, her delightful little ears&mdash;the whole of her face, full of
      love and tenderness, bespoke beauty in full health, the gayety which comes
      from the accomplishment of duty, and the serene conviction that by loving
      life she would live as she ought to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! so you&rsquo;ve come then!&rdquo; Mathieu exclaimed, as soon as he was near
      her. &ldquo;But I begged you not to come out so late. Are you not afraid at
      being alone on the roads at this time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to laugh. &ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when the night is so mild and
      healthful? Besides, wouldn&rsquo;t you rather have me here to kiss you ten
      minutes sooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those simple words brought tears to Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes. All the murkiness, all
      the shame through which he had passed in Paris horrified him. He tenderly
      took his wife in his arms, and they exchanged the closest, the most human
      of kisses amid the quiet of the slumbering fields. After the scorching
      pavement of Paris, after the eager struggling of the day and the degrading
      spectacles of the night, how reposeful was that far-spreading silence,
      that faint bluish radiance, that endless unrolling of plains, steeped in
      refreshing gloom and dreaming of fructification by the morrow&rsquo;s sun! And
      what suggestions of health, and rectitude, and felicity rose from
      productive Nature, who fell asleep beneath the dew of night solely that
      she might reawaken in triumph, ever and ever rejuvenated by life&rsquo;s
      torrent, which streams even through the dust of her paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu slowly seated Marianne on the low broad parapet once more. He kept
      her near his heart; it was a halt full of affection, which neither could
      forego, in presence of the universal peace that came to them from the
      stars, and the waters, and the woods, and the endless fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a splendid night!&rdquo; murmured Mathieu. &ldquo;How beautiful and how pleasant
      to live in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s rapture, during which they both heard their hearts
      beating, he began to tell her of his day. She questioned him with loving
      interest, and he answered, happy at having to tell her no lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Beauchenes cannot come here on Sunday. Constance never cared much
      for us, as you well know. Their boy Maurice is suffering in the legs; Dr.
      Boutan was there, and the question of children was discussed again. I will
      tell you all about that. On the other hand, the Moranges have promised to
      come. You can&rsquo;t have an idea of the delight and vanity they displayed in
      showing me their new flat. What with their eagerness to make a big fortune
      I&rsquo;m much afraid that those worthy folks will do something very foolish.
      Oh! I was forgetting. I called on the landlord, and though I had a good
      deal of difficulty over it, he ended by consenting to have the roof
      entirely relaid. Ah! what a home, too, those Seguins have! I came away
      feeling quite scared. But I will tell you all about it by and by with the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne evinced no loquacious curiosity; she quietly awaited his
      confidences, and showed anxiety only respecting themselves and the
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You received your salary, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you need not be afraid about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not afraid, it&rsquo;s only our little debts which worry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she asked again: &ldquo;And did your business dinner go off all right? I
      was afraid that Beauchene might detain you and make you miss your train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied that everything had gone off properly, but as he spoke he
      flushed and felt a pang at his heart. To rid himself of his emotion he
      affected sudden gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you, my dear,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how did you manage with your thirty
      sous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thirty sous!&rdquo; she gayly responded, &ldquo;why, I was much too rich; we fared
      like princes, all five of us, and I have six sous left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in her turn, she gave an account of her day, her daily life, pure as
      crystal. She recapitulated what she had done, what she had said; she
      related how the children had behaved, and she entered into the minutest
      details respecting them and the house. With her, moreover, one day was
      like another; each morning she set herself to live the same life afresh,
      with never-failing happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, though, we had a visit,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;Madame Lepailleur, the woman
      from the mill over yonder, came to tell me that she had some fine chickens
      for sale. As we owe her twelve francs for eggs and milk, I believe that
      she simply called to see if I meant to pay her. I told her that I would go
      to her place to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking Marianne had pointed through the gloom towards a big black
      pile, a little way down the Yeuse. It was an old water-mill which was
      still worked, and the Lepailleurs had now been installed in it for three
      generations. The last of them, Francois Lepailleur, who considered himself
      to be no fool, had come back from his military service with little
      inclination to work, and an idea that the mill would never enrich him, any
      more than it had enriched his father and grandfather. It then occurred to
      him to marry a peasant farmer&rsquo;s daughter, Victoire Cornu, whose dowry
      consisted of some neighboring fields skirting the Yeuse. And the young
      couple then lived fairly at their ease, on the produce of those fields and
      such small quantities of corn as the peasants of the district still
      brought to be ground at the old mill. If the antiquated and badly repaired
      mechanism of the mill had been replaced by modern appliances, and if the
      land, instead of being impoverished by adherence to old-fashioned
      practices, had fallen into the hands of an intelligent man who believed in
      progress, there would no doubt have been a fortune in it all. But
      Lepailleur was not only disgusted with work, he treated the soil with
      contempt. He indeed typified the peasant who has grown weary of his
      eternal mistress, the mistress whom his forefathers loved too much.
      Remembering that, in spite of all their efforts to fertilize the soil, it
      had never made them rich or happy, he had ended by hating it. All his
      faith in its powers had departed; he accused it of having lost its
      fertility, of being used up and decrepit, like some old cow which one
      sends to the slaughter-house. And, according to him, everything went
      wrong: the soil simply devoured the seed sown in it, the weather was never
      such as it should be, the seasons no longer came in their proper order.
      Briefly, it was all a premeditated disaster brought about by some evil
      power which had a spite against the peasantry, who were foolish to give
      their sweat and their blood to such a thankless creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Lepailleur brought her boy with her, a little fellow three years
      old, called Antonin,&rdquo; resumed Marianne, &ldquo;and we fell to talking of
      children together. She quite surprised me. Peasant folks, you know, used
      to have such large families. But she declared that one child was quite
      enough. Yet she&rsquo;s only twenty-four, and her husband not yet twenty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks revived the thoughts which had filled Mathieu&rsquo;s mind all
      day. For a moment he remained silent. Then he said, &ldquo;She gave you her
      reasons, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give reasons&mdash;she, with her head like a horse&rsquo;s, her long freckled
      face, pale eyes, and tight, miserly mouth&mdash;I think she&rsquo;s simply a
      fool, ever in admiration before her husband because he fought in Africa
      and reads the newspapers. All that I could get out of her was that
      children cost one a good deal more than they bring in. But the husband, no
      doubt, has ideas of his own. You have seen him, haven&rsquo;t you? A tall, slim
      fellow, as carroty and as scraggy as his wife, with an angular face, green
      eyes, and prominent cheekbones. He looks as though he had never felt in a
      good humor in his life. And I understand that he is always complaining of
      his father-in-law, because the other had three daughters and a son. Of
      course that cut down his wife&rsquo;s dowry; she inherited only a part of her
      father&rsquo;s property. And, besides, as the trade of a miller never enriched
      his father, Lepailleur curses his mill from morning till night, and
      declares that he won&rsquo;t prevent his boy Antonin from going to eat white
      bread in Paris, if he can find a good berth there when he grows up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, even among the country folks, Mathieu found a small family the rule.
      Among the causes were the fear of having to split up an inheritance, the
      desire to rise in the social system, the disgust of manual toil, and the
      thirst for the luxuries of town life. Since the soil was becoming
      bankrupt, why indeed continue tilling it, when one knew that one would
      never grow rich by doing so? Mathieu was on the point of explaining these
      things to his wife, but he hesitated, and then simply said: &ldquo;Lepailleur
      does wrong to complain; he has two cows and a horse, and when there is
      urgent work he can take an assistant. We, this morning, had just thirty
      sous belonging to us, and we own no mill, no scrap of land. For my part I
      think his mill superb; I envy him every time I cross this bridge. Just
      fancy! we two being the millers&mdash;why, we should be very rich and very
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made them both laugh, and for another moment they remained seated
      there, watching the dark massive mill beside the Yeuse. Between the
      willows and poplars on both banks the little river flowed on peacefully,
      scarce murmuring as it coursed among the water plants which made it
      ripple. Then, amid a clump of oaks, appeared the big shed sheltering the
      wheel, and the other buildings garlanded with ivy, honeysuckle, and
      creepers, the whole forming a spot of romantic prettiness. And at night,
      especially when the mill slept, without a light at any of its windows,
      there was nothing of more dreamy, more gentle charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; remarked Mathieu, lowering his voice, &ldquo;there is somebody under the
      willows, beside the water. I heard a slight noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Marianne with tender gayety. &ldquo;It must be the young
      couple who settled themselves in the little house yonder a fortnight ago.
      You know whom I mean&mdash;Madame Angelin, that schoolmate of
      Constance&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Angelins, who had become their neighbors, interested the Froments. The
      wife was of the same age as Marianne, tall, dark, with fine hair and fine
      eyes, radiant with continual joy, and fond of pleasure. And the husband
      was of the same age as Mathieu, a handsome fellow, very much in love, with
      moustaches waving in the wind, and the joyous spirits of a musketeer. They
      had married with sudden passion for one another, having between them an
      income of some ten thousand francs a year, which the husband, a fan
      painter with a pretty talent, might have doubled had it not been for the
      spirit of amorous idleness into which his marriage had thrown him. And
      that spring-time they had sought a refuge in that desert of Janville, that
      they might love freely, passionately, in the midst of nature. They were
      always to be met, holding each other by the waist, on the secluded paths
      in the woods; and at night they loved to stroll across the fields, beside
      the hedges, along the shady banks of the Yeuse, delighted when they could
      linger till very late near the murmuring water, in the thick shade of the
      willows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was quite another side to their idyl, and Marianne mentioned it
      to her husband. She had chatted with Madame Angelin, and it appeared that
      the latter wished to enjoy life, at all events for the present, and did
      not desire to be burdened with children. Then Mathieu&rsquo;s worrying thoughts
      once more came back to him, and again at this fresh example he wondered
      who was right&mdash;he who stood alone in his belief, or all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he muttered at last, &ldquo;we all live according to our fancy. But
      come, my dear, let us go in; we disturb them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They slowly climbed the narrow road leading to Chantebled, where the lamp
      shone out like a beacon. When Mathieu had bolted the front door they
      groped their way upstairs. The ground floor of their little house
      comprised a dining-room and a drawing-room on the right hand of the hall,
      and a kitchen and a store place on the left. Upstairs there were four
      bedrooms. Their scanty furniture seemed quite lost in those big rooms;
      but, exempt from vanity as they were, they merely laughed at this. By way
      of luxury they had simply hung some little curtains of red stuff at the
      windows, and the ruddy reflection from these hangings seemed to them to
      impart wonderfully rich cheerfulness to their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Zoe, their peasant servant, asleep over her knitting beside the
      lamp in their own bedroom, and they had to wake her and send her as
      quietly as possible to bed. Then Mathieu took up the lamp and entered the
      children&rsquo;s room to kiss them and make sure that they were comfortable. It
      was seldom they awoke on these occasions. Having placed the lamp on the
      mantelshelf, he still stood there looking at the three little beds when
      Marianne joined him. In the bed against the wall at one end of the room
      lay Blaise and Denis, the twins, sturdy little fellows six years of age;
      while in the second bed against the opposite wall was Ambroise, now nearly
      four and quite a little cherub. And the third bed, a cradle, was occupied
      by Mademoiselle Rose, fifteen months of age and weaned for three weeks
      past. She lay there half naked, showing her white flowerlike skin, and her
      mother had to cover her up with the bedclothes, which she had thrust aside
      with her self-willed little fists. Meantime the father busied himself with
      Ambroise&rsquo;s pillow, which had slipped aside. Both husband and wife came and
      went very gently, and bent again and again over the children&rsquo;s faces to
      make sure that they were sleeping peacefully. They kissed them and
      lingered yet a little longer, fancying that they had heard Blaise and
      Denis stirring. At last the mother took up the lamp and they went off, one
      after the other, on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were in their room again Marianne exclaimed: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to
      worry you while we were out, but Rose made me feel anxious to-day; I did
      not find her well, and it was only this evening that I felt more at ease
      about her.&rdquo; Then, seeing that Mathieu started and turned pale, she went
      on: &ldquo;Oh! it was nothing. I should not have gone out if I had felt the
      least fear for her. But with those little folks one is never free from
      anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then began to make her preparations for the night; but Mathieu,
      instead of imitating her, sat down at the table where the lamp stood, and
      drew the money paid to him by Morange from his pocket. When he had counted
      those three hundred francs, those fifteen louis, he said in a bitter,
      jesting way, &ldquo;The money hasn&rsquo;t grown on the road. Here it is; you can pay
      our debts to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark gave him a fresh idea. Taking his pencil he began to jot down
      the various amounts they owed on a blank page of his pocket diary. &ldquo;We say
      twelve francs to the Lepailleurs for eggs and milk. How much do you owe
      the butcher?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The butcher,&rdquo; replied Marianne, who had sat down to take off her shoes;
      &ldquo;well, say twenty francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the grocer and the baker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but about thirty francs altogether. There is nobody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu added up the items: &ldquo;That makes sixty-two francs,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Take them away from three hundred, and we shall have two hundred and
      thirty-eight left. Eight francs a day at the utmost. Well, we have a nice
      month before us, with our four children to feed, particularly if little
      Rose should fall ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark surprised his wife, who laughed gayly and confidently, saying:
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you to-night, my dear? You seem to be almost
      in despair, when as a rule you look forward to the morrow as full of
      promise. You have often said that it was sufficient to love life if one
      wished to live happily. As for me, you know, with you and the little ones
      I feel the happiest, richest woman in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Mathieu could restrain himself no longer. He shook his head and
      mournfully began to recapitulate the day he had just spent. At great
      length he relieved his long-pent-up feelings. He spoke of their poverty
      and the prosperity of others. He spoke of the Beauchenes, the Moranges,
      the Seguins, the Lepailleurs, of all he had seen of them, of all they had
      said, of all their scarcely disguised contempt for an improvident
      starveling like himself. He, Mathieu, and she, Marianne, would never have
      factory, nor mansion, nor mill, nor an income of twelve thousand francs a
      year; and their increasing penury, as the others said, had been their own
      work. They had certainly shown themselves imprudent, improvident. And he
      went on with his recollections, telling Marianne that he feared nothing
      for himself, but that he did not wish to condemn her and the little ones
      to want and poverty. She was surprised at first, and by degrees became
      colder, more constrained, as he told her all that he had upon his mind.
      Tears slowly welled into her eyes; and at last, however lovingly he spoke,
      she could no longer restrain herself, but burst into sobs. She did not
      question what he said, she spoke no words of revolt, but it was evident
      that her whole being rebelled, and that her heart was sorely grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, greatly troubled when he saw her tears. Something akin to her
      own feelings came upon him. He was terribly distressed, angry with
      himself. &ldquo;Do not weep, my darling!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he pressed her to him:
      &ldquo;it was stupid, brutal, and wrong of me to speak to you in that way. Don&rsquo;t
      distress yourself, I beg you; we&rsquo;ll think it all over and talk about it
      some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased to weep, but she continued silent, clinging to him, with her
      head resting on his shoulder. And Mathieu, by the side of that loving,
      trustful woman, all health and rectitude and purity, felt more and more
      confused, more and more ashamed of himself, ashamed of having given heed
      to the base, sordid, calculating principles which others made the basis of
      their lives. He thought with loathing of the sudden frenzy which had
      possessed him during the evening in Paris. Some poison must have been
      instilled into his veins; he could not recognize himself. But honor and
      rectitude, clear-sightedness and trustfulness in life were fast returning.
      Through the window, which had remained open, all the sounds of the lovely
      spring night poured into the room. It was spring, the season of love, and
      beneath the palpitating stars in the broad heavens, from fields and
      forests and waters came the murmur of germinating life. And never had
      Mathieu more fully realized that, whatever loss may result, whatever
      difficulty may arise, whatever fate may be in store, all the creative
      powers of the world, whether of the animal order, whether of the order of
      the plants, for ever and ever wage life&rsquo;s great incessant battle against
      death. Man alone, dissolute and diseased among all the other denizens of
      the world, all the healthful forces of nature, seeks death for death&rsquo;s
      sake, the annihilation of his species. Then Mathieu again caught his wife
      in a close embrace, printing on her lips a long, ardent kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dear heart, forgive me; I doubted both of us. It would be impossible
      for either of us to sleep unless you forgive me. Well, let the others hold
      us in derision and contempt if they choose. Let us love and live as nature
      tells us, for you are right: therein lies true wisdom and true courage.&rdquo;

    <p>
      MATHIEU rose noiselessly from his little folding iron bedstead beside the
      large one of mahogany, on which Marianne lay alone. He looked at her, and
      saw that she was awake and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you are not asleep?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I hardly dared to stir for fear of
      waking you. It is nearly nine o&rsquo;clock, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday morning. January had come round, and they were in Paris.
      During the first fortnight in December the weather had proved frightful at
      Chantebled, icy rains being followed by snow and terrible cold. This
      rigorous temperature, coupled with the circumstance that Marianne was
      again expecting to become a mother, had finally induced Mathieu to accept
      Beauchene&rsquo;s amiable offer to place at his disposal the little pavilion in
      the Rue de la Federation, where the founder of the works had lived before
      building the superb house on the quay. An old foreman who had occupied
      this pavilion, which still contained the simple furniture of former days,
      had lately died. And the young folks, desiring to be near their friend,
      worthy Dr. Boutan, had lived there for a month now, and did not intend to
      return to Chantebled until the first fine days in April.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; resumed Mathieu; &ldquo;I will let the light in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thereupon drew back one of the curtains, and a broad ray of yellow,
      wintry sunshine illumined the dim room. &ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s the sun! And it&rsquo;s
      splendid weather&mdash;and Sunday too! I shall be able to take you out for
      a little while with the children this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Marianne called him to her, and, when he had seated himself on the
      bed, took hold of his hand and said gayly: &ldquo;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t been sleeping
      either for the last twenty minutes; and I didn&rsquo;t move because I wanted you
      to lie in bed a little late, as it&rsquo;s Sunday. How amusing to think that we
      were afraid of waking one another when we both had our eyes wide open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was so happy to think you were sleeping. My one delight
      on Sundays now is to remain in this room all the morning, and spend the
      whole day with you and the children.&rdquo; Then he uttered a cry of surprise
      and remorse: &ldquo;Why! I haven&rsquo;t kissed you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had raised herself on her pillows, and he gave her an eager clasp. In
      the stream of bright sunshine which gilded the bed she herself looked
      radiant with health and strength and hope. Never had her heavy brown
      tresses flowed down more abundantly, never had her big eyes smiled with
      gayer courage. And sturdy and healthful as she was, with her face all
      kindliness and love, she looked like the very personification of
      Fruitfulness, the good goddess with dazzling skin and perfect flesh, of
      sovereign dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained for a moment clasped together in the golden sunshine which
      enveloped them with radiance. Then Mathieu pulled up Marianne&rsquo;s pillows,
      set the counterpane in order, and forbade her to stir until he had tidied
      the room. Forthwith he stripped his little bedstead, folded up the sheets,
      the mattress, and the bedstead itself, over which he slipped a cover. She
      vainly begged him not to trouble, saying that Zoe, the servant whom they
      had brought from the country, could very well do all those things. But he
      persisted, replying that the servant plagued him, and that he preferred to
      be alone to attend her and do all that there was to do. Then, as he
      suddenly began to shiver, he remarked that the room was cold, and blamed
      himself for not having already lighted the fire. Some logs and some small
      wood were piled in a corner, near the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;here am I leaving you to freeze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he knelt down before the fireplace, while she protested: &ldquo;What an
      idea! Leave all that, and call Zoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, she doesn&rsquo;t know how to light the fire properly, and besides, it
      amuses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed triumphantly when a bright clear fire began to crackle, filling
      the room with additional cheerfulness. The place was now a little
      paradise, said he; but he had scarcely finished washing and dressing when
      the partition behind the bed was shaken by a vigorous thumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the rascals,&rdquo; he gayly exclaimed. &ldquo;They are awake, you see! Oh! well,
      we may let them come, since to-day is Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments there had been a noise as of an aviary in commotion in
      the adjoining room. Prattling, shrill chirping, and ringing bursts of
      laughter could be heard. Then came a noise as of pillows and bolsters
      flying about, while two little fists continued pummelling the partition as
      if it were a drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the mother, smiling and anxious, &ldquo;answer them; tell them
      to come. They will be breaking everything if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the father himself struck the wall, at which a victorious
      outburst, cries of triumphal delight, arose on the other side. And Mathieu
      scarcely had time to open the door before tramping and scuffling could be
      heard in the passage. A triumphal entry followed. All four of them wore
      long nightdresses falling to their little bare feet, and they trotted
      along and laughed, with their brown hair streaming about, their faces
      quite pink, and their eyes radiant with candid delight. Ambroise, though
      he was younger than his brothers, marched first, for he was the boldest
      and most enterprising. Behind him came the twins, Blaise and Denis, who
      were less turbulent&mdash;the latter especially. He taught the others to
      read, while Blaise, who was rather shy and timid, remained the dreamer of
      them all. And each gave a hand to little Mademoiselle Rose, who looked
      like an angel, pulled now to the right and now to the left amid bursts of
      laughter, while she contrived to keep herself steadily erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mamma,&rdquo; cried Ambroise, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadfully cold, you know; do make me a
      little room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith he bounded into the bed, slipped under the coverlet, and nestled
      close to his mother, so that only his laughing face and fine curly hair
      could be seen. But at this the two others raised a shout of war, and
      rushed forward in their turn upon the besieged citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a little room for us, mamma, make a little room! By your back,
      mamma! Near your shoulder, mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only little Rose remained on the floor, feeling quite vexed and indignant.
      She had vainly attempted the assault, but had fallen back. &ldquo;And me, mamma,
      and me,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to help her in her endeavors to hoist herself up with her
      little hands. Then her mother took her in her arms in order that she might
      have the best place of all. Mathieu had at first felt somewhat anxious at
      seeing Marianne thus disturbed, but she laughed and told him not to
      trouble. And then the picture they all presented as they nestled there was
      so charming, so full of gayety, that he also smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice, it&rsquo;s so warm,&rdquo; said Ambroise, who was fond of taking his
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Denis, the reasonable member of the band, began to explain why it was
      they had made so much noise &ldquo;Blaise said that he had seen a spider. And
      then he felt frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This accusation of cowardice vexed his brother, who replied: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      true. I did see a spider, but I threw my pillow at it to kill it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I! so did I!&rdquo; stammered Rose, again laughing wildly. &ldquo;I threw my
      pillow like that&mdash;houp! houp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all roared and wriggled again, so amusing did it seem to them. The
      truth was that they had engaged in a pillow fight under pretence of
      killing a spider, which Blaise alone said that he had seen. This
      unsupported testimony left the matter rather doubtful. But the whole brood
      looked so healthful and fresh in the bright sunshine that their father
      could not resist taking them in his arms, and kissing them here and there,
      wherever his lips lighted, a final game which sent them into perfect
      rapture amid a fresh explosion of laughter and shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what fun! what fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Marianne exclaimed, as she succeeded in freeing herself
      somewhat from the embraces of the children, &ldquo;all the same, you know, I
      want to get up. I mustn&rsquo;t idle, for it does me no good. And besides, you
      little ones need to be washed and dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dressed in front of the big blazing fire; and it was nearly ten
      o&rsquo;clock when they at last went down into the dining-room, where the
      earthenware stove was roaring, while the warm breakfast milk steamed upon
      the table. The ground floor of the pavilion comprised a dining-room and a
      drawing-room on the right of the hall, and a kitchen and a study on the
      left. The dining-room, like the principal bedchamber, overlooked the Rue
      de la Federation, and was filled every morning with cheerfulness by the
      rising sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were already at table, with their noses in their cups, when a
      ring at the street door was heard. And it was Dr. Boutan who came in. His
      arrival brought a renewal of noisy mirth, for the youngsters were fond of
      his round, good-natured face. He had attended them all at their births,
      and treated them like an old friend, with whom familiarity is allowable.
      And so they were already thrusting back their chairs to dart towards the
      doctor, when a remark from their mother restrained them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, please just leave the doctor quiet,&rdquo; said she, adding gayly, &ldquo;Good
      morning, doctor. I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for this bright sunshine, for I&rsquo;m
      sure you ordered it so that I might go for a walk this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course I ordered it&mdash;I was passing this way, and
      thought I would look in to see how you were getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boutan took a chair and seated himself near the table, while Mathieu
      explained to him that they had remained late in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is all right, let her rest: but she must also take as much
      exercise as possible. However, there is no cause to worry. I see that she
      has a good appetite. When I find my patients at table, I cease to be a
      doctor, you know, I am simply a friend making a call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he put a few questions, which the children, who were busy
      breakfasting, did not hear. And afterwards there came a pause in the
      conversation, which the doctor himself resumed, following, no doubt, some
      train of thought which he did not explain: &ldquo;I hear that you are to lunch
      with the Seguins next Thursday,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ah! poor little woman! That is
      a terrible affair of hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture he expressed his feelings concerning the drama that had
      just upset the Seguins&rsquo; household. Valentine, like Marianne, was to become
      a mother. For her part she was in despair at it, and her husband had given
      way to jealous fury. For a time, amid all their quarrels, they had
      continued leading their usual life of pleasure, but she now spent her days
      on a couch, while he neglected her and reverted to a bachelor&rsquo;s life. It
      was a very painful story, but the doctor was in hopes that Marianne, on
      the occasion of her visit to the Seguins, might bring some good influence
      to bear on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair and was about to retire, when the attack which had
      all along threatened him burst forth. The children, unsuspectedly rising
      from their chairs, had concerted together with a glance, and now they
      opened their campaign. The worthy doctor all at once found the twins upon
      his shoulders, while the younger boy clasped him round the waist and the
      little girl clung to his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puff! puff! do the railway train, do the railway train, please do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pushed and shook him, amid peal after peal of flute-like laughter,
      while their father and mother rushed to his assistance, scolding and
      angry. But he calmed the parents by saying: &ldquo;Let them be! they are simply
      wishing me good day. And besides, I must bear with them, you know, since,
      as our friend Beauchene says, it is a little bit my fault if they are in
      the world. What charms me with your children is that they enjoy such good
      health, just like their mother. For the present, at all events, one can
      ask nothing more of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had set them down on the floor, and given each a smacking kiss, he
      took hold of Marianne&rsquo;s hands and said to her that everything was going on
      beautifully, and that he was very pleased. Then he went off, escorted to
      the front door by Mathieu, the pair of them jesting and laughing gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly after the midday meal Mathieu wished to go out, in order that
      Marianne might profit by the bright sunshine. The children had been
      dressed in readiness before sitting down to table, and it was scarcely
      more than one o&rsquo;clock when the family turned the corner of the Rue de la
      Federation and found itself upon the quays.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portion of Grenelle, lying between the Champ de Mars and the densely
      populated streets of the centre of the district, has an aspect all its
      own, characterized by vast bare expanses, and long and almost deserted
      streets running at right angles and fringed by factories with lofty,
      interminable gray walls. During work-hours nobody passes along these
      streets, and on raising one&rsquo;s head one sees only lofty chimneys belching
      forth thick coal smoke above the roofs of big buildings with dusty window
      panes. And if any large cart entrance happens to be open one may espy deep
      yards crowded with drays and full of acrid vapor. The only sounds are the
      strident puffs of jets of steam, the dull rumbling of machinery, and the
      sudden rattle of ironwork lowered from the carts to the pavement. But on
      Sundays the factories do not work, and the district then falls into
      death-like silence. In summer time there is but bright sunshine heating
      the pavement, in winter some icy snow-laden wind rushing down the lonely
      streets. The population of Grenelle is said to be the worst of Paris, both
      the most vicious and the most wretched. The neighborhood of the Ecole
      Militaire attracts thither a swarm of worthless women, who bring in their
      train all the scum of the populace. In contrast to all this the gay
      bourgeois district of Passy rises up across the Seine; while the rich
      aristocratic quarters of the Invalides and the Faubourg St. Germain spread
      out close by. Thus the Beauchene works on the quay, as their owner
      laughingly said, turned their back upon misery and looked towards all the
      prosperity and gayety of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was very partial to the avenues, planted with fine trees, which
      radiate from the Champ de Mars and the Esplanade des Invalides, supplying
      great gaps for air and sunlight. But he was particularly fond of that long
      diversified Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, which starts from the Rue du Bac in the very
      centre of the city, passes before the Palais Bourbon, crosses first the
      Esplanade des Invalides, and then the Champ de Mars, to end at the
      Boulevard de Grenelle, in the black factory region. How majestically it
      spread out, what fine old leafy trees there were round that bend of the
      Seine from the State Tobacco Works to the garden of the Eiffel Tower! The
      river winds along with sovereign gracefulness; the avenue stretches out
      under superb foliage. You can really saunter there amid delicious
      quietude, instinct as it were with all the charm and power of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thither that Mathieu wished to take his wife and the little ones
      that Sunday. But the distance was considerable, and some anxiety was felt
      respecting Rose&rsquo;s little legs. She was intrusted to Ambroise, who,
      although the youngest of the boys, was already energetic and determined.
      These two opened the march; then came Blaise and Denis, the twins, the
      parents bringing up the rear. Everything at first went remarkably well:
      they strolled on slowly in the gay sunshine. That beautiful winter
      afternoon was exquisitely pure and clear, and though it was very cold in
      the shade, all seemed golden and velvety in the stretches of bright light.
      There were a great many people out of doors&mdash;all the idle folks, clad
      in their Sunday best, whom the faintest sunshine draws in crowds to the
      promenades of Paris. Little Rose, feeling warm and gay, drew herself up as
      if to show the people that she was a big girl. She crossed the whole
      extent of the Champ de Mars without asking to be carried. And her three
      brothers strode along making the frozen pavement resound beneath their
      steps. Promenaders were ever turning round to watch them. In other cities
      of Europe the sight of a young married couple preceded by four children
      would have excited no comment, but here in Paris the spectacle was so
      unusual that remarks of astonishment, sarcasm, and even compassion were
      exchanged. Mathieu and Marianne divined, even if they did not actually
      hear, these comments, but they cared nothing for them. They bravely went
      their way, smiling at one another, and feeling convinced that the course
      they had taken in life was the right one, whatever other folks might think
      or say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o&rsquo;clock when they turned their steps homeward; and Marianne,
      feeling rather tired, then took a little rest on a sofa in the
      drawing-room, where Zoe had previously lighted a good fire. The children,
      quieted by fatigue, were sitting round a little table, listening to a tale
      which Denis read from a story-book, when a visitor was announced. This
      proved to be Constance, who, after driving out with Maurice, had thought
      of calling to inquire after Marianne, whom she saw only once or twice a
      week, although the little pavilion was merely separated by a garden from
      the large house on the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! are you poorly, my dear?&rdquo; she inquired as she entered the room and
      perceived Marianne on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, no,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but I have been out walking for the
      last two hours and am now taking some rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had brought an armchair forward for his wife&rsquo;s rich, vain cousin,
      who, whatever her real feelings, certainly strove to appear amiable. She
      apologized for not being able to call more frequently, and explained what
      a number of duties she had to discharge as mistress of her home. Meantime
      Maurice, clad in black velvet, hung round her petticoats, gazing from a
      distance at the other children, who one and all returned his scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Maurice,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you wish your little cousins
      good-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to do as he was bidden and step towards them. But all five remained
      embarrassed. They seldom met, and had as yet had no opportunity to
      quarrel. The four little savages of Chantebled felt indeed almost out of
      their element in the presence of this young Parisian with bourgeois
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are all your little folks quite well?&rdquo; resumed Constance, who, with
      her sharp eyes, was comparing her son with the other lads. &ldquo;Ambroise has
      grown; his elder brothers also look very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her examination did not apparently result to Maurice&rsquo;s advantage. The
      latter was tall and looked sturdy, but he had quite a waxen complexion.
      Nevertheless, the glance that Constance gave the others was full of irony,
      disdain, and condemnation. When she had first heard that Marianne was
      likely to become a mother once more she had made no secret of her
      disapproval. She held to her old opinions more vigorously than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, knowing full well that they would fall out if they discussed the
      subject of children, sought another topic of conversation. She inquired
      after Beauchene. &ldquo;And Alexandre,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;why did you not bring him
      with you? I haven&rsquo;t seen him for a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; broke in Mathieu, &ldquo;I told you he had gone shooting yesterday
      evening. He slept, no doubt, at Puymoreau, the other side of Chantebled,
      so as to be in the woods at daybreak this morning, and he probably won&rsquo;t
      be home till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, I remember now. Well, it&rsquo;s nice weather to be in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was another perilous subject, and Marianne regretted having
      broached it, for, truth to tell, one never knew where Beauchene might
      really be when he claimed to have gone shooting. He availed himself so
      often of this pretext to absent himself from home that Constance was
      doubtless aware of the truth. But in the presence of that household, whose
      union was so perfect, she was determined to show a brave front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is I who compel him to go about and take
      as much exercise as possible. He has a temperament that needs the open
      air. Shooting is very good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this same moment there came another ring at the door, announcing
      another visitor. And this time it was Madame Morange who entered the room,
      with her daughter Reine. She colored when she caught sight of Madame
      Beauchene, so keenly was she impressed by that perfect model of wealth and
      distinction, whom she ever strove to imitate. Constance, however, profited
      by the diversion of Valerie&rsquo;s arrival to declare that she unfortunately
      could not remain any longer, as a friend must now be waiting for her at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at all events, leave us Maurice,&rdquo; suggested Mathieu. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Reine
      here now, and all six children can play a little while together. I will
      bring you the boy by and by, when he has had a little snack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Maurice had already once more sought refuge among his mother&rsquo;s skirts.
      And she refused the invitation. &ldquo;Oh! no, no!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He has to keep to
      a certain diet, you know, and he must not eat anything away from home.
      Good-by; I must be off. I called only to inquire after you all in passing.
      Keep well; good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she led her boy away, never speaking to Valerie, but simply shaking
      hands with her in a familiar, protecting fashion, which the other
      considered to be extremely distinguished. Reine, on her side, had smiled
      at Maurice, whom she already slightly knew. She looked delightful that day
      in her gown of thick blue cloth, her face smiling under her heavy black
      tresses, and showing such a likeness to her mother that she seemed to be
      the latter&rsquo;s younger sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, quite charmed, called the girl to her: &ldquo;Come and kiss me, my
      dear! Oh! what a pretty young lady! Why, she is getting quite beautiful
      and tall. How old is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly thirteen,&rdquo; Valerie replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself in the armchair vacated by Constance, and Mathieu
      noticed what a keen expression of anxiety there was in her soft eyes.
      After mentioning that she also had called in passing to make inquiries,
      and declaring that both mother and children looked remarkably well, she
      relapsed into gloomy silence, scarcely listening to Marianne, who thanked
      her for having come. Thereupon it occurred to Mathieu to leave her with
      his wife. To him it seemed that she must have something on her mind, and
      perhaps she wished to make a confidante of Marianne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Reine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come with these little ones into the
      dining-room. We will see what afternoon snack there is, and lay the
      cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal was greeted with shouts of delight, and all the children
      trooped into the dining-room with Mathieu. A quarter of an hour later,
      when everything was ready there, and Valerie came in, the latter&rsquo;s eyes
      looked very red, as if she had been weeping. And that evening, when
      Mathieu was alone with his wife, he learnt what the trouble was. Morange&rsquo;s
      scheme of leaving the Beauchene works and entering the service of the
      Credit National, where he would speedily rise to a high and lucrative
      position, his hope too of giving Reine a big dowry and marrying her off to
      advantage&mdash;all the ambitious dreams of rank and wealth in which his
      wife and he had indulged, now showed no likelihood of fulfilment, since it
      seemed probable that Valerie might again have a child. Both she and her
      husband were in despair over it, and though Marianne had done her utmost
      to pacify her friend and reconcile her to circumstances, there were
      reasons to fear that in her distracted condition she might do something
      desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, when the Froments lunched with the Seguins du Hordel at
      the luxurious mansion in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, they came upon similar
      trouble there. Seguin, who was positively enraged, did not scruple to
      accuse his wife of infidelity, and, on his side, he took to quite a
      bachelor life. He had been a gambler in his younger days, and had never
      fully cured himself of that passion, which now broke out afresh, like a
      fire which has only slumbered for a time. He spent night after night at
      his club, playing at baccarat, and could be met in the betting ring at
      every race meeting. Then, too, he glided into equivocal society and
      appeared at home only at intervals to vent his irritation and spite and
      jealousy upon his ailing wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, poor woman, was absolutely guiltless of the charges preferred against
      her. But knowing her husband, and unwilling for her own part to give up
      her life of pleasure, she had practised concealment as long as possible.
      And now she was really very ill, haunted too by an unreasoning,
      irremovable fear that it would all end in her death. Mathieu, who had seen
      her but a few months previously looking so fair and fresh, was amazed to
      find her such a wreck. And on her side Valentine gazed, all astonishment,
      at Marianne, noticing with surprise how calm and strong the young woman
      seemed, and how limpid her clear and smiling eyes remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the Froments&rsquo; visit Seguin had gone out early in the
      morning, and when they arrived he had not yet returned. Thus the lunch was
      for a short time kept waiting, and during the interval Celeste, the maid,
      entered the room where the visitors sat near her mistress, who was
      stretched upon a sofa, looking a perfect picture of distress. Valentine
      turned a questioning glance on the servant, who forthwith replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame, Monsieur has not come back yet. But that woman of my village
      is here. You know, madame, the woman I spoke to you about, Sophie Couteau,
      La Couteau as we call her at Rougemont, who brings nurses to Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; exclaimed Valentine, on the point of ordering Celeste
      to leave the room, for it seemed to her quite outrageous to be disturbed
      in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, she&rsquo;s here; and as I told you before, if you would intrust
      her with the matter now she would find a very good wet nurse for you in
      the country, and bring her here whenever she&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau had been standing behind the door, which had remained ajar, and
      scarcely had Celeste finished than, without waiting for an invitation, she
      boldly entered the room. She was a quick little wizened woman, with
      certain peasant ways, but considerably polished by her frequent journeys
      to Paris. So far as her small keen eyes and pointed nose went her long
      face was not unpleasant, but its expression of good nature was marred by
      her hard mouth, her thin lips, suggestive of artfulness and cupidity. Her
      gown of dark woollen stuff, her black cape, black mittens, and black cap
      with yellow ribbons, gave her the appearance of a respectable countrywoman
      going to mass in her Sunday best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been a nurse?&rdquo; Valentine inquired, as she scrutinized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; replied La Couteau, &ldquo;but that was ten years ago, when I was
      only twenty. It seemed to me that I wasn&rsquo;t likely to make much money by
      remaining a nurse, and so I preferred to set up as an agent to bring
      others to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she smiled, like an intelligent woman who feels that those
      who give their services as wet nurses to bourgeois families are simply
      fools and dupes. However, she feared that she might have said too much on
      the point, and so she added: &ldquo;But one does what one can, eh, madame? The
      doctor told me that I should never do for a nurse again, and so I thought
      that I might perhaps help the poor little dears in another manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you bring wet nurses to the Paris offices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, twice a month. I supply several offices, but more
      particularly Madame Broquette&rsquo;s office in the Rue Roquepine. It&rsquo;s a very
      respectable place, where one runs no risk of being deceived&mdash;And so,
      if you like, madame, I will choose the very best I can find for you&mdash;the
      pick of the bunch, so to say. I know the business thoroughly, and you can
      rely on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As her mistress did not immediately reply, Celeste ventured to intervene,
      and began by explaining how it happened that La Couteau had called that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she goes back into the country, madame, she almost always takes a
      baby with her, sometimes a nurse&rsquo;s child, and sometimes the child of
      people who are not well enough off to keep a nurse in the house. And she
      takes these children to some of the rearers in the country. She just now
      came to see me before going round to my friend Madame Menoux, whose baby
      she is to take away with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine became interested. This Madame Menoux was a haberdasher in the
      neighborhood and a great friend of Celeste&rsquo;s. She had married a former
      soldier, a tall handsome fellow, who now earned a hundred and fifty francs
      a month as an attendant at a museum. She was very fond of him, and had
      bravely set up a little shop, the profits from which doubled their income,
      in such wise that they lived very happily and almost at their ease.
      Celeste, who frequently absented herself from her duties to spend hours
      gossiping in Madame Menoux&rsquo;s little shop, was forever being scolded for
      this practice; but in the present instance Valentine, full of anxiety and
      curiosity, did not chide her. The maid was quite proud at being
      questioned, and informed her mistress that Madame Menoux&rsquo;s baby was a fine
      little boy, and that the mother had been attended by a certain Madame
      Rouche, who lived at the lower end of the Rue du Rocher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who recommended her,&rdquo; continued the servant, &ldquo;for a friend of
      mine whom she had attended had spoken to me very highly of her. No doubt
      she has not such a good position as Madame Bourdieu, who has so handsome a
      place in the Rue de Miromesnil, but she is less expensive, and so very
      kind and obliging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Celeste suddenly ceased speaking, for she noticed that Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes
      were fixed upon her, and this, for reasons best known to herself, made her
      feel uncomfortable. He on his side certainly placed no confidence in this
      big dark girl with a head like that of a horse, who, it seemed to him,
      knew far too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne joined in the conversation. &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked she, &ldquo;why does not
      this Madame Menoux, whom you speak about, keep her baby with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon La Couteau turned a dark harsh glance upon this lady visitor,
      who, whatever course she might take herself, had certainly no right to
      prevent others from doing business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed Celeste, well pleased with the diversion.
      &ldquo;Madame Menoux&rsquo;s shop is no bigger than my pocket-handkerchief, and at the
      back of it there is only one little room where she and her husband take
      their meals and sleep. And that room, too, overlooks a tiny courtyard
      where one can neither see nor breathe. The baby would not live a week in
      such a place. And, besides, Madame Menoux would not have time to attend to
      the child. She has never had a servant, and what with waiting on customers
      and having to cook meals in time for her husband&rsquo;s return from the museum,
      she never has a moment to spare. Oh! if she could, she would be very happy
      to keep the little fellow with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Marianne sadly; &ldquo;there are some poor mothers whom I
      pity with all my heart. This person you speak of is not in poverty, and
      yet is reduced to this cruel separation. For my part, I should not be able
      to exist if a child of mine were taken away from me to some unknown spot
      and given to another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau doubtless interpreted this as an attack upon herself. Assuming
      the kindly demeanor of one who dotes on children, the air which she always
      put on to prevail over hesitating mothers, she replied: &ldquo;Oh, Rougemont is
      such a very pretty place. And then it&rsquo;s not far from Bayeux, so that folks
      are by no means savages there. The air is so pure, too, that people come
      there to recruit their health. And, besides, the little ones who are
      confided to us are well cared for, I assure you. One would have to be
      heartless to do otherwise than love such little angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, like Celeste, she relapsed into silence on seeing how
      significantly Mathieu was looking at her. Perhaps, in spite of her rustic
      ways, she understood that there was a false ring in her voice. Besides, of
      what use was her usual patter about the salubrity of the region, since
      that lady, Madame Seguin, wished to have a nurse at her house? So she
      resumed: &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s understood, madame, I will bring you the best we have,
      a real treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, now a little tranquillized as to her fears for herself, found
      strength to speak out. &ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t pledge myself in advance. I will
      send to see the nurses you bring to the office, and we shall see if there
      is one to suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without occupying herself further about the woman, she turned to
      Marianne, and asked: &ldquo;Shall you nurse your baby yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, as I did with the others. We have very decided opinions on
      that point, my husband and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. I understand you: I should much like to do the same myself; but
      it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau had remained there motionless, vexed at having come on a
      fruitless errand, and regretting the loss of the present which she would
      have earned by her obligingness in providing a nurse. She put all her
      spite into a glance which she shot at Marianne, who, thought she, was
      evidently some poor creature unable even to afford a nurse. However, at a
      sign which Celeste made her, she courtesied humbly and withdrew in the
      company of the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards, Seguin arrived, and, repairing to the
      dining-room, they all sat down to lunch there. It was a very luxurious
      meal, comprising eggs, red mullet, game, and crawfish, with red and white
      Bordeaux wines and iced champagne. Such diet for Valentine and Marianne
      would never have met with Dr. Boutan&rsquo;s approval; but Seguin declared the
      doctor to be an unbearable individual whom nobody could ever please.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, Seguin, while showing all politeness to his guests, seemed that day to
      be in an execrable temper. Again and again he levelled annoying and even
      galling remarks at his wife, carrying things to such a point at times that
      tears came to the unfortunate woman&rsquo;s eyes. Now that he scarcely set foot
      in the house he complained that everything was going wrong there. If he
      spent his time elsewhere it was, according to him, entirely his wife&rsquo;s
      fault. The place was becoming a perfect hell upon earth. And in
      everything, the slightest incident, the most common-place remark, he found
      an opportunity for jeers and gibes. These made Mathieu and Marianne
      extremely uncomfortable; but at last he let fall such a harsh expression
      that Valentine indignantly rebelled, and he had to apologize. At heart he
      feared her, especially when the blood of the Vaugelades arose within her,
      and she gave him to understand, in her haughty disdainful way, that she
      would some day revenge herself on him for his treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, seeking another outlet for his spite and rancor, he at last
      turned to Mathieu, and spoke of Chantebled, saying bitterly that the game
      in the covers there was fast becoming scarcer and scarcer, in such wise
      that he now had difficulty in selling his shooting shares, so that his
      income from the property was dwindling every year. He made no secret of
      the fact that he would much like to sell the estate, but where could he
      possibly find a purchaser for those unproductive woods, those sterile
      plains, those marshes and those tracts of gravel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu listened to all this attentively, for during his long walks in the
      summer he had begun to take an interest in the estate. &ldquo;Are you really of
      opinion that it cannot be cultivated?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pitiful to see all
      that land lying waste and idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cultivate it!&rdquo; cried Seguin. &ldquo;Ah! I should like to see such a miracle!
      The only crops that one will ever raise on it are stones and frogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had by this time eaten their dessert, and before rising from table
      Marianne was telling Valentine that she would much like to see and kiss
      her children, who had not been allowed to lunch with their elders on
      account of their supposed unruly ways, when a couple of visitors arrived
      in turn, and everything else was forgotten. One was Santerre the novelist,
      who of late had seldom called on the Seguins, and the other, much to
      Mathieu&rsquo;s dislike, proved to be Beauchene&rsquo;s sister, Seraphine, the
      Baroness de Lowicz. She looked at the young man in a bold, provoking,
      significant manner, and then, like Santerre, cast a sly glance of mocking
      contempt at Marianne and Valentine. She and the novelist between them soon
      turned the conversation on to subjects that appealed to their vicious
      tastes. And Santerre related that he had lately seen Doctor Gaude perform
      several operations at the Marbeuf Hospital. He had found there the usual
      set of society men who attend first performances at the theatres, and
      indeed there were also some women present.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he enlarged upon the subject, giving the crudest and most precise
      particulars, much to the delight of Seguin, who every now and again
      interpolated remarks of approval, while both Mathieu and Marianne grew
      more and more ill at ease. The young woman sat looking with amazement at
      Santerre as he calmly recapitulated horror after horror, to the evident
      enjoyment of the others. She remembered having read his last book, that
      love story which had seemed to her so supremely absurd, with its theories
      of the annihilation of the human species. And she at last glanced at
      Mathieu to tell him how weary she felt of all the semi-society and
      semi-medical chatter around her, and how much she would like to go off
      home, leaning on his arm, and walking slowly along the sunlit quays. He,
      for his part, felt a pang at seeing so much insanity rife amid those
      wealthy surroundings. He made his wife a sign that it was indeed time to
      take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you going already!&rdquo; Valentine then exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, I dare not
      detain you if you feel tired.&rdquo; However, when Marianne begged her to kiss
      the children for her, she added: &ldquo;Why, yes, it&rsquo;s true you have not seen
      them. Wait a moment, pray; I want you to kiss them yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Celeste appeared in answer to the bell, she announced that
      Monsieur Gaston and Mademoiselle Lucie had gone out with their governess.
      And this made Seguin explode once more. All his rancor against his wife
      revived. The house was going to rack and ruin. She spent her days lying on
      a sofa. Since when had the governess taken leave to go out with the
      children without saying anything? One could not even see the children now
      in order to kiss them. It was a nice state of things. They were left to
      the servants; in fact, it was the servants now who controlled the house.

    <p>
      Thereupon Valentine began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; said Marianne to her husband, when she found herself
      out of doors, able to breathe, and happy once more now that she was
      leaning on his arm; &ldquo;why, they are quite mad, the people in that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mathieu responded, &ldquo;they are mad, no doubt; but we must pity them,
      for they know not what happiness is.&rdquo;

      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      ABOUT nine o&rsquo;clock one fine cold morning, a few days afterwards, as
      Mathieu, bound for his office, a little late through having lingered near
      his wife, was striding hastily across the garden which separated the
      pavilion from the factory yard, he met Constance and Maurice, who, clad in
      furs, were going out for a walk in the sharp air. Beauchene, who was
      accompanying them as far as the gate, bareheaded and ever sturdy and
      victorious, gayly exclaimed to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the youngster a good spin on his legs! Let him take in all the fresh
      air he can. There&rsquo;s nothing like that and good food to make a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, on hearing this, stopped short. &ldquo;Has Maurice been poorly again?&rdquo;
       he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; hastily replied the boy&rsquo;s mother, with an appearance of great
      gayety, assumed perhaps from an unconscious desire to hide certain covert
      fears. &ldquo;Only the doctor wants him to take exercise, and it is so fine this
      morning that we are going off on quite an expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go along the quays,&rdquo; said Beauchene again. &ldquo;Go up towards the
      Invalides. He&rsquo;ll have much stiffer marching to do when he&rsquo;s a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, the mother and the child having taken themselves off, he went back
      into the works with Mathieu, adding in his triumphant way: &ldquo;That
      youngster, you know, is as strong as an oak. But women are always so
      nervous. For my part, I&rsquo;m quite easy in mind about him, as you can see.&rdquo;
       And with a laugh he concluded: &ldquo;When one has but one son, he keeps him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That same day, about an hour later, a terrible dispute which broke out
      between old Moineaud&rsquo;s daughters, Norine and Euphrasie, threw the factory
      into a state of commotion. Norine&rsquo;s intrigue with Beauchene had ended in
      the usual way. He had soon tired of the girl and betaken himself to some
      other passing fancy, leaving her to her tears, her shame, and all the
      consequences of her fault; for although it had hitherto been possible for
      her to conceal her condition from her parents, she was unable to deceive
      her sister, who was her constant companion. The two girls were always
      bickering, and Norine had for some time lived in dread of scandal and
      exposure. And that day the trouble came to a climax, beginning with a
      trivial dispute about a bit of glass-paper in the workroom, then
      developing into a furious exchange of coarse, insulting language, and
      culminating in a frantic outburst from Euphrasie, who shrieked to the
      assembled work-girls all that she knew about her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an outrageous scene: the sisters fought, clawing and scratching
      one another desperately, and could not be separated until Beauchene,
      Mathieu, and Morange, attracted by the extraordinary uproar, rushed into
      the workroom and restored a little order. Fortunately for Beauchene,
      Euphrasie did not know the whole truth, and Norine, after giving her
      employer a humble, supplicating glance, kept silence; but old Moineaud was
      present, and the public revelation of his daughter&rsquo;s shame sent him into a
      fury. He ordered Norine out of the works forthwith, and threatened to
      throw her out of window should he find her at home when he returned there
      in the evening. And Beauchene, both annoyed at the scandal and ashamed at
      being the primary cause of it, did not venture to interfere. It was only
      after the unhappy Norine had rushed off sobbing that he found strength of
      mind to attempt to pacify the father, and assert his authority in the
      workroom by threatening to dismiss one and all of the girls if the
      slightest scandal, the slightest noise, should ever occur there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was deeply pained by the scene, but kept his own counsel. What
      most astonished him was the promptness with which Beauchene regained his
      self-possession as soon as Norine had fled, and the majesty with which he
      withdrew to his office after threatening the others and restoring order.
      Another whom the scene had painfully affected was Morange, whom Mathieu,
      to his surprise, found ghastly pale, with trembling hands, as if indeed he
      had had some share of responsibility in this unhappy business. But
      Morange, as he confided to Mathieu, was distressed for other reasons. The
      scene in the workroom, the revelation of Norine&rsquo;s condition, the fate
      awaiting the girl driven away into the bleak, icy streets, had revived all
      his own poignant worries with respect to Valerie. Mathieu had already
      heard of the latter&rsquo;s trouble from his wife, and he speedily grasped the
      accountant&rsquo;s meaning. It vaguely seemed to him also that Morange was
      yielding to the same unreasoning despair as Valerie, and was almost
      willing that she should take the desperate course which she had hinted to
      Marianne. But it was a very serious matter, and Mathieu did not wish to be
      in any way mixed up in it. Having tried his best to pacify the cashier, he
      sought forgetfulness of these painful incidents in his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, however, a little girl, Cecile Moineaud, the old fitter&rsquo;s
      youngest daughter, slipped into his office, with a message from her
      mother, beseeching him to speak with her. He readily understood that the
      woman wished to see him respecting Norine, and in his usual compassionate
      way he consented to go. The interview took place in one of the adjacent
      streets, down which the cold winter wind was blowing. La Moineaude was
      there with Norine and another little girl of hers, Irma, a child eight
      years of age. Both Norine and her mother wept abundantly while begging
      Mathieu to help them. He alone knew the whole truth, and was in a position
      to approach Beauchene on the subject. La Moineaude was firmly determined
      to say nothing to her husband. She trembled for his future and that of her
      son Alfred, who was now employed at the works; for there was no telling
      what might happen if Beauchene&rsquo;s name should be mentioned. Life was indeed
      hard enough already, and what would become of them all should the family
      bread-winners be turned away from the factory? Norine certainly had no
      legal claim on Beauchene, the law being peremptory on that point; but, now
      that she had lost her employment, and was driven from home by her father,
      could he leave her to die of want in the streets? The girl tried to
      enforce her moral claim by asserting that she had always been virtuous
      before meeting Beauchene. In any case, her lot remained a very hard one.
      That Beauchene was the father of her child there could be no doubt; and at
      last Mathieu, without promising success, told the mother that he would do
      all he could in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his word that same afternoon, and after a great deal of difficulty
      he succeeded. At first Beauchene fumed, stormed, denied, equivocated,
      almost blamed Mathieu for interfering, talked too of blackmail, and put on
      all sorts of high and mighty airs. But at heart the matter greatly worried
      him. What if Norine or her mother should go to his wife? Constance might
      close her eyes as long as she simply suspected things, but if complaints
      were formally, openly made to her, there would be a terrible scandal. On
      the other hand, however, should he do anything for the girl, it would
      become known, and everybody would regard him as responsible. And then
      there would be no end to what he called the blackmailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when Beauchene reached this stage Mathieu felt that the battle
      was gained. He smiled and answered: &ldquo;Of course, one can never tell&mdash;the
      girl is certainly not malicious. But when women are driven beyond
      endurance, they become capable of the worst follies. I must say that she
      made no demands of me; she did not even explain what she wanted; she
      simply said that she could not remain in the streets in this bleak
      weather, since her father had turned her away from home. If you want my
      opinion, it is this: I think that one might at once put her to board at a
      proper place. Let us say that four or five months will elapse before she
      is able to work again; that would mean a round sum of five hundred francs
      in expenses. At that cost she might be properly looked after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene walked nervously up and down, and then replied: &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t
      a bad heart, as you know. Five hundred francs more or less will not
      inconvenience me. If I flew into a temper just now it was because the mere
      idea of being robbed and imposed upon puts me beside myself. But if it&rsquo;s a
      question of charity, why, then, do as you suggest. It must be understood,
      however, that I won&rsquo;t mix myself up in anything; I wish even to remain
      ignorant of what you do. Choose a nurse, place the girl where you please,
      and I will simply pay the bill. Neither more nor less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he heaved a sigh of relief at the prospect of being extricated from
      this equivocal position, the worry of which he refused to acknowledge. And
      once more he put on the mien of a superior, victorious man, one who is
      certain that he will win all the battles of life. In fact, he even jested
      about the girl, and at last went off repeating his instructions: &ldquo;See that
      my conditions are fully understood. I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about
      any child. Do whatever you please, but never let me hear another word of
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day was certainly one fertile in incidents, for in the evening there
      was quite an alarm at the Beauchenes. At the moment when they were about
      to sit down to dinner little Maurice fainted away and fell upon the floor.
      Nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed before the child could be revived, and
      meantime the distracted parents quarrelled and shouted, accusing one
      another of having compelled the lad to go out walking that morning in such
      cold, frosty weather. It was evidently that foolish outing which had
      chilled him. At least, this was what they said to one another by way of
      quieting their anxiety. Constance, while she held her boy in her arms,
      pictured him as dead. It occurred to her for the first time that she might
      possibly lose him. At this idea she experienced a terrible heart-pang, and
      a feeling of motherliness came upon her, so acute that it was like a
      revelation. The ambitious woman that was in her, she who dreamt of royalty
      for that only son, the future princely owner of the ever-growing family
      fortune, likewise suffered horribly. If she was to lose that son she would
      have no child left. Why had she none other? Was it not she who had willed
      it thus? At this thought a feeling of desperate regret shot through her
      like a red-hot blade, burning her cruelly to the very depths of her being.
      Maurice, however, at last recovered consciousness, and even sat down to
      the table and ate with a fair appetite. Then Beauchene immediately
      shrugged his shoulders, and began to jest about the unreasoning fears of
      women. And as time went by Constance herself ceased to think of the
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, when Mathieu had to attend to the delicate mission which he
      had undertaken, he remembered the two women of whom Celeste, the maid, had
      spoken on the day of his visit to the Seguins. He at first dismissed all
      idea of that Madame Rouche, of whom the girl had spoken so strangely, but
      he thought of making some inquiries respecting Madame Bourdieu, who
      accommodated boarders at the little house where she resided in the Rue de
      Miromesnil. And he seemed to remember that this woman had attended Madame
      Morange at the time of Reine&rsquo;s birth, a circumstance which induced him to
      question the cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very first words the latter seemed greatly disturbed. &ldquo;Yes, a lady
      friend recommended Madame Bourdieu to my wife,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but why do you
      ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke he looked at Mathieu with an expression of anguish, as if
      that sudden mention of Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s name signified that the young
      fellow had guessed his secret preoccupations. It was as though he had been
      abruptly surprised in wrong-doing. Perhaps, too, certain dim, haunting
      thoughts, which he had long been painfully revolving in his mind, without
      as yet being able to come to a decision, took shape at that moment. At all
      events, he turned pale and his lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Mathieu gave him to understand that it was a question of placing
      Norine somewhere, he involuntarily let an avowal escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife was speaking to me of Madame Bourdieu only this morning,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know how it happened, but, as you are aware, Reine was
      born so many years ago that I can&rsquo;t give you any precise information. It
      seems that the woman has done well, and is now at the head of a
      first-class establishment. Inquire there yourself; I have no doubt you
      will find what you want there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu followed this advice; but at the same time, as he had been warned
      that Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s terms were rather high, he stifled his prejudices
      and began by repairing to the Rue du Rocher in order to reconnoitre Madame
      Rouche&rsquo;s establishment and make some inquiries of her. The mere aspect of
      the place chilled him. It was one of the black houses of old Paris, with a
      dark, evil-smelling passage, leading into a small yard which the nurse&rsquo;s
      few squalid rooms overlooked. Above the passage entrance was a yellow
      signboard which simply bore the name of Madame Rouche in big letters. She
      herself proved to be a person of five- or six-and-thirty, gowned in black
      and spare of figure, with a leaden complexion, scanty hair of no precise
      color, and a big nose of unusual prominence. With her low, drawling
      speech, her prudent, cat-like gestures, and her sour smile, he divined her
      to be a dangerous, unscrupulous woman. She told him that, as the
      accommodation at her disposal was so small, she only took boarders for a
      limited time, and this of course enabled him to curtail his inquiries.
      Glad to have done with her, he hurried off, oppressed by nausea and
      vaguely frightened by what he had seen of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s establishment, a little three-storied
      house in the Rue de Miromesnil, between the Rue La Boetie and the Rue de
      Penthievre, offered an engaging aspect, with its bright facade and
      muslin-curtained windows. And Madame Bourdieu, then two-and-thirty, rather
      short and stout, had a broad, pleasant white face, which had greatly
      helped her on the road to success. She expatiated to Mathieu on the
      preliminary training that was required by one of her profession, the cost
      of it, the efforts needed to make a position, the responsibilities, the
      inspections, the worries of all sorts that she had to face; and she
      plainly told the young man that her charge for a boarder would be two
      hundred francs a month. This was far more than he was empowered to give;
      however, after some further conversation, when Madame Bourdieu learnt that
      it was a question of four months&rsquo; board, she became more accommodating,
      and agreed to accept a round sum of six hundred francs for the entire
      period, provided that the person for whom Mathieu was acting would consent
      to occupy a three-bedded room with two other boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether there were about a dozen boarders&rsquo; rooms in the house, some of
      these having three, and even four, beds; while others, the terms for which
      were naturally higher, contained but one. Madame Bourdieu could
      accommodate as many as thirty boarders, and as a rule, she had some
      five-and-twenty staying on her premises. Provided they complied with the
      regulations, no questions were asked them. They were not required to say
      who they were or whence they came, and in most cases they were merely
      known by some Christian name which they chose to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu ended by agreeing to Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s terms, and that same
      evening Norine was taken to her establishment. Some little trouble ensued
      with Beauchene, who protested when he learnt that five hundred francs
      would not suffice to defray the expenses. However, Mathieu managed affairs
      so diplomatically that at last the other not only became reconciled to the
      terms, but provided the money to purchase a little linen, and even agreed
      to supply pocket-money to the extent of ten francs a month. Thus, five
      days after Norine had entered Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s establishment, Mathieu
      decided to return thither to hand the girl her first ten francs and tell
      her that he had settled everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her there in the boarders&rsquo; refectory with some of her companions
      in the house&mdash;a tall, thin, severe-looking Englishwoman, with
      lifeless eyes and bloodless lips, who called herself Amy, and a pale
      red-haired girl with a tip-tilted nose and a big mouth, who was known as
      Victoire. Then, too, there was a young person of great beauty answering to
      the name of Rosine, a jeweller&rsquo;s daughter, so Norine told Mathieu, whose
      story was at once pathetic and horrible. The young man, while waiting to
      see Madame Bourdieu, who was engaged, sat for a time answering Norine&rsquo;s
      questions, and listening to the others, who conversed before him in a free
      and open way. His heart was wrung by much that he heard, and as soon as he
      could rid himself of Norine he returned to the waiting-room, eager to
      complete his business. There, however, two women who wished to consult
      Madame Bourdieu, and who sat chatting side by side on a sofa, told him
      that she was still engaged, so that he was compelled to tarry a little
      longer. He ensconced himself in a large armchair, and taking a newspaper
      from his pocket, began to read it. But he had not been thus occupied for
      many minutes before the door opened and a servant entered, ushering in a
      lady dressed in black and thickly veiled, whom she asked to be good enough
      to wait her turn. Mathieu was on the point of rising, for, though his back
      was turned to the door, he could see, in a looking-glass, that the new
      arrival was none other than Morange&rsquo;s wife, Valerie. After a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, however, the sight of her black gown and thick veil, which
      seemed to indicate that she desired to escape recognition, induced him to
      dive back into his armchair and feign extreme attention to his newspaper.
      She, on her side, had certainly not noticed him, but by glancing slantwise
      towards the looking-glass he could observe all her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the conversation between the other women on the sofa continued,
      and to Mathieu&rsquo;s surprise it suddenly turned on Madame Rouche, concerning
      whom one of them began telling the most horrible stories, which fully
      confirmed the young man&rsquo;s previous suspicions. These stories seemed to
      have a powerful fascination for Valerie, who sat in a corner, never
      stirring, but listening intently. She did not even turn her head towards
      the other women, but, beneath her veil, Mathieu could detect her big eyes
      glittering feverishly. She started but once. It was when one of the others
      inquired of her friend where that horrid creature La Rouche resided, and
      the other replied, &ldquo;At the lower end of the Rue du Rocher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then their chatter abruptly ceased, for Madame Bourdieu made her
      appearance on the threshold of her private room. The gossips exchanged
      only a few words with her, and then, as Mathieu remained in his armchair,
      the high back of which concealed him from view, Valerie rose from her seat
      and followed Madame Bourdieu into the private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was alone the young man let his newspaper fall upon his
      knees, and lapsed into a reverie, haunted by all the chatter he had heard,
      both there and in Norine&rsquo;s company, and shuddering at the thought of the
      dreadful secrets that had been revealed to him. How long an interval
      elapsed he could not tell, but at last he was suddenly roused by a sound
      of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Bourdieu was now escorting Valerie to the door. She had the same
      plump fresh face as usual, and even smiled in a motherly way; but the
      other was quivering, as with distress and grief. &ldquo;You are not sensible, my
      dear child,&rdquo; said Madame Bourdieu to her. &ldquo;It is simply foolish of you.
      Come, go home and be good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, Valerie having withdrawn without uttering a word, Madame Bourdieu
      was greatly surprised to see Mathieu, who had risen from his chair. And
      she suddenly became serious, displeased with herself at having spoken in
      his presence. Fortunately, a diversion was created by the arrival of
      Norine, who came in from the refectory; and Mathieu then promptly settled
      his business and went off, after promising Norine that he would return
      some day to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make up for lost time he was walking hastily towards the Rue La Boetie,
      when, all at once, he came to a halt, for at the very corner of that
      street he again perceived Valerie, now talking to a man, none other than
      her husband. So Morange had come with her, and had waited for her in the
      street while she interviewed Madame Bourdieu. And now they both stood
      there consulting together, hesitating and evidently in distress. It was
      plain to Mathieu that a terrible combat was going on within them. They
      stamped about, moved hither and thither in a feverish way, then halted
      once more to resume their conversation in a whisper. At one moment the
      young man felt intensely relieved, for, turning into the Rue La Boetie,
      they walked on slowly, as if downcast and resigned, in the direction of
      Grenelle. But all at once they halted once more and exchanged a few words;
      and then Mathieu&rsquo;s heart contracted as he saw them retrace their steps
      along the Rue La Boetie and follow the Rue de la Pepiniere as far as the
      Rue du Rocher. He readily divined whither they were going, but some
      irresistible force impelled him to follow them; and before long, from an
      open doorway, in which he prudently concealed himself, he saw them look
      round to ascertain whether they were observed, and then slink, first the
      wife and afterwards the husband, into the dark passage of La Rouche&rsquo;s
      house. For a moment Mathieu lingered in his hiding-place, quivering, full
      of dread and horror; and when at last he turned his steps homeward it was
      with a heavy heart indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeks went by, the winter ran its course, and March had come round,
      when the memory of all that the young fellow had heard and seen that day&mdash;things
      which he had vainly striven to forget&mdash;was revived in the most
      startling fashion. One morning at eight o&rsquo;clock Morange abruptly called at
      the little pavilion in the Rue de la Federation, accompanied by his
      daughter Reine. The cashier was livid, haggard, distracted, and as soon as
      Reine had joined Mathieu&rsquo;s children, and could not hear what he said, he
      implored the young man to come with him. In a gasp he told the dreadful
      truth&mdash;Valerie was dying. Her daughter believed her to be in the
      country, but that was a mere fib devised to quiet the girl. Valerie was
      elsewhere, in Paris, and he, Morange, had a cab waiting below, but lacked
      the strength to go back to her alone, so poignant was his grief, so great
      his dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was expecting a happy event that very day, and he at first told
      the cashier that he could not possibly go with him; but when he had
      informed Marianne that he believed that something dreadful had happened to
      the Moranges, she bravely bade him render all assistance. And then the two
      men drove, as Mathieu had anticipated, to the Rue du Rocher, and there
      found the hapless Valerie, not dying, but dead, and white, and icy cold.
      Ah! the desperate, tearless grief of the husband, who fell upon his knees
      at the bedside, benumbed, annihilated, as if he also felt death&rsquo;s heavy
      hand upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, indeed, the young man anticipated exposure and scandal. But
      when he hinted this to La Rouche she faintly smiled. She had friends on
      many sides, it seemed. She had already reported Valerie&rsquo;s death at the
      municipal office, and the doctor, who would be sent to certify the demise,
      would simply ascribe it to natural causes. Such was the usual practice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu bethought himself of leading Morange away; but the other,
      still plunged in painful stupor, did not heed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend, I pray you, say nothing,&rdquo; he at last replied, in a
      very faint, distant voice, as though he feared to awaken the unfortunate
      woman who had fallen asleep forever. &ldquo;I know what I have done; I shall
      never forgive myself. If she lies there, it is because I consented. Yet I
      adored her, and never wished her aught but happiness. I loved her too
      much, and I was weak. Still, I was the husband, and when her madness came
      upon her I ought to have acted sensibly, and have warned and dissuaded
      her. I can understand and excuse her, poor creature; but as for me, it is
      all over; I am a wretch; I feel horrified with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All his mediocrity and tenderness of heart sobbed forth in this confession
      of his weakness. And his voice never gave sign of animation, never rose in
      a louder tone from the depths of his annihilated being, which would
      evermore be void. &ldquo;She wished to be gay, and rich, and happy,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;It was so legitimate a wish on her part, she was so
      intelligent and beautiful! There was only one delight for me, to content
      her tastes and satisfy her ambition. You know our new flat. We spent far
      too much money on it. Then came that story of the Credit National and the
      hope of speedily rising to fortune. And thus, when the trouble came, and I
      saw her distracted at the idea of having to renounce all her dreams, I
      became as mad as she was, and suffered her to do her will. We thought that
      our only means of escaping from everlasting penury and drudgery was to
      evade Nature, and now, alas! she lies there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange&rsquo;s lugubrious voice, never broken by a sob, never rising to
      violence, but sounding like a distant, monotonous, mournful knell, rent
      Mathieu&rsquo;s heart. He sought words of consolation, and spoke of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I am very fond of Reine. She is so like her
      mother. You will keep her at your house till to-morrow, won&rsquo;t you? Tell
      her nothing; let her play; I will acquaint her with this dreadful
      misfortune. And don&rsquo;t worry me, I beg you, don&rsquo;t take me away. I promise
      you that I will keep very quiet: I will simply stay here, watching her.
      Nobody will even hear me; I shan&rsquo;t disturb any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his voice faltered and he stammered a few more incoherent phrases as
      he sank into a dream of his wrecked life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, seeing him so quiet, so overcome, at last decided to leave him
      there, and, entering the waiting cab, drove back to Grenelle. Ah! it was
      indeed relief for him to see the crowded, sunlit streets again, and to
      breathe the keen air which came in at both windows of the vehicle.
      Emerging from that horrid gloom, he breathed gladly beneath the vast sky,
      all radiant with healthy joy. And the image of Marianne arose before him
      like a consolatory promise of life&rsquo;s coming victory, an atonement for
      every shame and iniquity. His dear wife, whom everlasting hope kept full
      of health and courage, and through whom, even amid her pangs, love would
      triumph, while they both held themselves in readiness for to-morrow&rsquo;s
      allotted effort! The cab rolled on so slowly that Mathieu almost
      despaired, eager as he was to reach his bright little house, that he might
      once more take part in life&rsquo;s poem, that august festival instinct with so
      much suffering and so much joy, humanity&rsquo;s everlasting hymn, the coming of
      a new being into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day, soon after his return, Denis and Blaise, Ambroise, Rose,
      and Reine were sent round to the Beauchenes&rsquo;, where they filled the house
      with their romping mirth. Maurice, however, was again ailing, and had to
      lie upon a sofa, disconsolate at being unable to take part in the play of
      the others. &ldquo;He has pains in his legs,&rdquo; said his father to Mathieu, when
      he came round to inquire after Marianne; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s growing so fast, and
      getting such a big fellow, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lightly as Beauchene spoke, his eyes even then wavered, and his face
      remained for a moment clouded. Perhaps, in his turn, he also had felt the
      passing of that icy breath from the unknown which one evening had made
      Constance shudder with dread whilst she clasped her swooning boy in her
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment Mathieu, who had left Marianne&rsquo;s room to answer
      Beauchene&rsquo;s inquiries, was summoned back again. And there he now found the
      sunlight streaming brilliantly, like a glorious greeting to new life.
      While he yet stood there, dazzled by the glow, the doctor said to him: &ldquo;It
      is a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu leant over his wife and kissed her lovingly. Her beautiful
      eyes were still moist with the tears of anguish, but she was already
      smiling with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear wife,&rdquo; said Mathieu, &ldquo;how good and brave you are, and how I
      love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am very happy,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;and I must try to give you
      back all the love that you give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! that room of battle and victory, it seemed radiant with triumphant
      glory. Elsewhere was death, darkness, shame, and crime, but here holy
      suffering had led to joy and pride, hope and trustfulness in the coming
      future. One single being born, a poor bare wee creature, raising the faint
      cry of a chilly fledgeling, and life&rsquo;s immense treasure was increased and
      eternity insured. Mathieu remembered one warm balmy spring night when,
      yonder at Chantebled, all the perfumes of fruitful nature had streamed
      into their room in the little hunting-box, and now around him amid equal
      rapture he beheld the ardent sunlight flaring, chanting the poem of
      eternal life that sprang from love the eternal.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I TELL you that I don&rsquo;t need Zoe to give the child a bath,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Mathieu half in anger. &ldquo;Stay in bed, and rest yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the servant must get the bath ready,&rdquo; replied Marianne, &ldquo;and bring
      you some warm water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as if amused by the dispute, and he ended by laughing also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days previously they had re-installed themselves in the little
      pavilion on the verge of the woods near Janville which they rented from
      the Seguins. So impatient, indeed, were they to find themselves once more
      among the fields that in spite of the doctor&rsquo;s advice Marianne had made
      the journey but fifteen days after giving birth to her little boy.
      However, a precocious springtide brought with it that March such balmy
      warmth and sunshine that the only ill-effect she experienced was a little
      fatigue. And so, on the day after their arrival&mdash;Sunday&mdash;Mathieu,
      glad at being able to remain with her, insisted that she should rest in
      bed, and only rise about noon, in time for dejeuner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I can very well attend to the child while you rest.
      You have him in your arms from morning till night. And, besides, if you
      only knew how pleased I am to be here again with you and the dear little
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached her to kiss her gently, and with a fresh laugh she returned
      his kiss. It was quite true: they were both delighted to be back at
      Chantebled, which recalled to them such loving memories. That room,
      looking towards the far expanse of sky and all the countryside, renascent,
      quivering with sap, was gilded with gayety by the early springtide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne leant over the cradle which was near her, beside the bed. &ldquo;The
      fact is,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Master Gervais is sound asleep. Just look at him. You
      will never have the heart to wake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then both father and mother remained for a moment gazing at their sleeping
      child. Marianne had passed her arm round her husband&rsquo;s neck and was
      clinging to him, as they laughed delightedly over the cradle in which the
      little one slumbered. He was a fine child, pink and white already; but
      only a father and mother could thus contemplate their offspring. As the
      baby opened his eyes, which were still full of all the mystery whence he
      had come, they raised exclamations full of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, he saw me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and me too. He looked at me: he turned his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the cherub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was but an illusion, but that dear little face, still so soft and
      silent, told them so many things which none other would have heard! They
      found themselves repeated in the child, mingled as it were together; and
      detected extraordinary likenesses, which for hours and for days kept them
      discussing the question as to which of them he most resembled. Moreover,
      each proved very obstinate, declaring that he was the living portrait of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, Master Gervais had no sooner opened his eyes than
      he began to shriek. But Marianne was pitiless: her rule was the bath first
      and milk afterwards. Zoe brought up a big jug of hot water, and then set
      out the little bath near the window in the sunlight. And Mathieu, all
      obstinacy, bathed the child, washing him with a soft sponge for some three
      minutes, while Marianne, from her bed, watched over the operation, jesting
      about the delicacy of touch that he displayed, as if the child were some
      fragile new-born divinity whom he feared to bruise with his big hands. At
      the same time they continued marvelling at the delightful scene. How
      pretty he looked in the water, his pink skin shining in the sunlight! And
      how well-behaved he was, for it was wonderful to see how quickly he ceased
      wailing and gave signs of satisfaction when he felt the all-enveloping
      caress of the warm water. Never had father and mother possessed such a
      little treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mathieu, when Zoe had helped him to wipe the boy with a
      fine cloth, &ldquo;and now we will weigh Master Gervais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a complicated operation, which was rendered the more difficult by
      the extreme repugnance that the child displayed. He struggled and wriggled
      on the platform of the weighing scales to such a degree that it was
      impossible to arrive at his correct weight, in order to ascertain how much
      this had increased since the previous occasion. As a rule, the increase
      varied from six to seven ounces a week. The father generally lost patience
      over the operation, and the mother had to intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! put the scales on the table near my bed, and give me the little one
      in his napkin. We will see what the napkin weighs afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, however, the customary morning invasion took place. The
      other four children, who were beginning to know how to dress themselves,
      the elder ones helping the younger, and Zoe lending a hand at times,
      darted in at a gallop, like frolicsome escaped colts. Having thrown
      themselves on papa&rsquo;s neck and rushed upon mamma&rsquo;s bed to say good-morning,
      the boys stopped short, full of admiration and interest at the sight of
      Gervais in the scales. Rose, however, still rather uncertain on her legs,
      caught hold of the scales in her impatient efforts to climb upon the bed,
      and almost toppled everything over. &ldquo;I want to see! I want to see!&rdquo; she
      cried in her shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the others likewise wished to meddle, and already stretched out
      their little hands, so that it became necessary to turn them out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now kindly oblige me by going to play outside,&rdquo; said Mathieu. &ldquo;Take your
      hats and remain under the window, so that we may hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in spite of the complaints and leaps of Master Gervais, Marianne was
      at last able to obtain his correct weight. And what delight there was, for
      he had gained more than seven ounces during the week. After losing weight
      during the first three days, like all new-born children, he was now
      growing and filling out like a strong, healthy human plant. They could
      already picture him walking, sturdy and handsome. His mother, sitting up
      in bed, wrapped his swaddling clothes around him with her deft, nimble
      hands, jesting the while and answering each of his plaintive wails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, we are very, very hungry. But it is all right; the soup
      is on the fire, and will be served to Monsieur smoking hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On awakening that morning she had made a real Sunday toilette: her superb
      hair was caught up in a huge chignon which disclosed the whiteness of her
      neck, and she wore a white flannel lace-trimmed dressing-jacket, which
      allowed but a little of her bare arms to be seen. Propped up by two
      pillows, she laughingly offered her breast to the child, who was already
      protruding his lips and groping with his hands. And when he found what he
      wanted he eagerly began to suck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, seeing that both mother and babe were steeped in sunshine, then
      went to draw one of the curtains, but Marianne exclaimed: &ldquo;No, no, leave
      us the sun; it doesn&rsquo;t inconvenience us at all, it fills our veins with
      springtide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came back and lingered near the bed. The sun&rsquo;s rays poured over it, and
      life blazed there in a florescence of health and beauty. There is no more
      glorious blossoming, no more sacred symbol of living eternity than an
      infant at its mother&rsquo;s breast. It is like a prolongation of maternity&rsquo;s
      travail, when the mother continues giving herself to her babe, offering
      him the fountain of life that shall make him a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce is he born to the world than she takes him back and clasps him to
      her bosom, that he may there again have warmth and nourishment. And
      nothing could be more simple or more necessary. Marianne, both for her own
      sake and that of her boy, in order that beauty and health might remain
      their portion, was naturally his nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gervais was still sucking when Zoe, after tidying the room, came up
      again with a big bunch of lilac, and announced that Monsieur and Madame
      Angelin had called, on their way back from an early walk, to inquire after
      Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show them up,&rdquo; said Marianne gayly; &ldquo;I can well receive them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Angelins were the young couple who, having installed themselves in a
      little house at Janville, ever roamed the lonely paths, absorbed in their
      mutual passion. She was delicious&mdash;dark, tall, admirably formed,
      always joyous and fond of pleasure. He, a handsome fellow, fair and square
      shouldered, had the gallant mien of a musketeer with his streaming
      moustache. In addition to their ten thousand francs a year, which enabled
      them to live as they liked, he earned a little money by painting pretty
      fans, flowery with roses and little women deftly postured. And so their
      life had hitherto been a game of love, an everlasting billing and cooing.
      Towards the close of the previous summer they had become quite intimate
      with the Froments, through meeting them well-nigh every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we come in? Are we not intruding?&rdquo; called Angelin, in his sonorous
      voice, from the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Claire, his wife, as soon as she had kissed Marianne, apologized for
      having called so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only learnt last night, my dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you had arrived the
      day before. We didn&rsquo;t expect you for another eight or ten days. And so, as
      we passed the house just now, we couldn&rsquo;t resist calling. You will forgive
      us, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Then, never waiting for an answer, she added with the
      petulant vivacity of a tom-tit whom the open air had intoxicated: &ldquo;Oh! so
      there is the new little gentleman&mdash;a boy, am I not right? And your
      health is good? But really I need not ask it. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what a
      pretty little fellow he is! Look at him, Robert; how pretty he is! A real
      little doll! Isn&rsquo;t he funny now, isn&rsquo;t he funny! He is quite amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, observing her gayety, drew near and began to admire the child
      by way of following her example. &ldquo;Ah yes, he is really a pretty baby. But
      I have seen so many frightful ones&mdash;thin, puny, bluish little things,
      looking like little plucked chickens. When they are white and plump they
      are quite nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu began to laugh, and twitted the Angelins on having no child of
      their own. But on this point they held very decided opinions. They wished
      to enjoy life, unburdened by offspring, while they were young. As for what
      might happen in five or six years&rsquo; time, that, of course, was another
      matter. Nevertheless, Madame Angelin could not help being struck by the
      delightful picture which Marianne, so fresh and gay, presented with her
      plump little babe at her breast in that white bed amid the bright
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she remarked: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing. I certainly could not feed a
      child. I should have to engage a nurse for any baby of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; her husband replied. &ldquo;I would never allow you to feed it. It
      would be idiotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words had scarcely passed his lips when he regretted them and
      apologized to Marianne, explaining that no mother possessed of means was
      nowadays willing to face the trouble and worry of nursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for my part,&rdquo; Marianne responded, with her quiet smile, &ldquo;if I had a
      hundred thousand francs a year I should nurse all my children, even were
      there a dozen of them. To begin with, it is so healthful, you know, both
      for mother and child: and if I didn&rsquo;t do my duty to the little one I
      should look on myself as a criminal, as a mother who grudged her offspring
      health and life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lowering her beautiful soft eyes towards her boy, she watched him with a
      look of infinite love, while he continued nursing gluttonously. And in a
      dreamy voice she continued: &ldquo;To give a child of mine to another&mdash;oh
      no, never! I should feel too jealous. I want my children to be entirely my
      own. And it isn&rsquo;t merely a question of a child&rsquo;s physical health. I speak
      of his whole being, of the intelligence and heart that will come to him,
      and which he ought to derive from me alone. If I should find him foolish
      or malicious later on, I should think that his nurse had poisoned him.
      Dear little fellow! when he pulls like that it is as if he were drinking
      me up entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu, deeply moved, turned towards the others, saying: &ldquo;Ah! she is
      quite right. I only wish that every mother could hear her, and make it the
      fashion in France once more to suckle their infants. It would be
      sufficient if it became an ideal of beauty. And, indeed, is it not of the
      loftiest and brightest beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Angelins complaisantly began to laugh, but they did not seem
      convinced. Just as they rose to take their leave an extraordinary uproar
      burst forth beneath the window, the piercing clamor of little wildings,
      freely romping in the fields. And it was all caused by Ambroise throwing a
      ball, which had lodged itself on a tree. Blaise and Denis were flinging
      stones at it to bring it down, and Rose called and jumped and stretched
      out her arms as if she hoped to be able to reach the ball. The Angelins
      stopped short, surprised and almost nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; murmured Claire, &ldquo;what will it be when you have a dozen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the house would seem quite dead if they did not romp and shout,&rdquo; said
      Marianne, much amused. &ldquo;Good-by, my dear. I will go to see you when I can
      get about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The months of March and April proved superb, and all went well with
      Marianne. Thus the lonely little house, nestling amid foliage, was ever
      joyous. Each Sunday in particular proved a joy, for the father did not
      then have to go to his office. On the other days he started off early in
      the morning, and returned about seven o&rsquo;clock, ever busily laden with work
      in the interval. And if his constant perambulations did not affect his
      good-humor, he was nevertheless often haunted by thoughts of the future.
      Formerly he had never been alarmed by the penury of his little home. Never
      had he indulged in any dream of ambition or wealth. Besides, he knew that
      his wife&rsquo;s only idea of happiness, like his own, was to live there in very
      simple fashion, leading a brave life of health, peacefulness, and love.
      But while he did not desire the power procured by a high position and the
      enjoyment offered by a large fortune, he could not help asking himself how
      he was to provide, were it ever so modestly, for his increasing family.
      What would he be able to do, should he have other children; how would he
      procure the necessaries of life each time that a fresh birth might impose
      fresh requirements upon him? One situated as he was must create resources,
      draw food from the earth step by step, each time a little mouth opened and
      cried its hunger aloud. Otherwise he would be guilty of criminal
      improvidence. And such reflections as these came upon him the more
      strongly as his penury had increased since the birth of Gervais&mdash;to
      such a point, indeed, that Marianne, despite prodigies of economy, no
      longer knew how to make her money last her till the end of the month. The
      slightest expenditure had to be debated; the very butter had to be spread
      thinly on the children&rsquo;s bread; and they had to continue wearing their
      blouses till they were well-nigh threadbare. To increase the embarrassment
      they grew every year, and cost more money. It had been necessary to send
      the three boys to a little school at Janville, which was as yet but a
      small expense. But would it not be necessary to send them the following
      year to a college, and where was the money for this to come from? A grave
      problem, a worry which grew from hour to hour, and which for Mathieu
      somewhat spoilt that charming spring whose advent was flowering the
      countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst was that Mathieu deemed himself immured, as it were, in his
      position as designer at the Beauchene works. Even admitting that his
      salary should some day be doubled, it was not seven or eight thousand
      francs a year which would enable him to realize his dream of a numerous
      family freely and proudly growing and spreading like some happy forest,
      indebted solely for strength, health, and beauty to the good common mother
      of all, the earth, which gave to all its sap. And this was why, since his
      return to Janville, the earth, the soil had attracted him, detained him
      during his frequent walks, while he revolved vague but ever-expanding
      thoughts in his mind. He would pause for long minutes, now before a field
      of wheat, now on the verge of a leafy wood, now on the margin of a river
      whose waters glistened in the sunshine, and now amid the nettles of some
      stony moorland. All sorts of vague plans then rose within him, uncertain
      reveries of such vast scope, such singularity, that he had as yet spoken
      of them to nobody, not even his wife. Others would doubtless have mocked
      at him, for he had as yet but reached that dim, quivering hour when
      inventors feel the gust of their discovery sweep over them, before the
      idea that they are revolving presents itself with full precision to their
      minds. Yet why did he not address himself to the soil, man&rsquo;s everlasting
      provider and nurse? Why did he not clear and fertilize those far-spreading
      lands, those woods, those heaths, those stretches of stony ground which
      were left sterile around him? Since it was just that each man should bring
      his contribution to the common weal, create subsistence for himself and
      his offspring, why should not he, at the advent of each new child, supply
      a new field of fertile earth which would give that child food, without
      cost to the community? That was his sole idea; it took no more precise
      shape; at the thought of realizing it he was carried off into splendid
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Froments had been in the country fully a month when one evening
      Marianne, wheeling Gervais&rsquo;s little carriage in front of her, came as far
      as the bridge over the Yeuse to await Mathieu, who had promised to return
      early. Indeed, he got there before six o&rsquo;clock. And as the evening was
      fine, it occurred to Marianne to go as far as the Lepailleurs&rsquo; mill down
      the river, and buy some new-laid eggs there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; said Mathieu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of their romantic old mill,
      you know; though if it were mine I should pull it down and build another
      one with proper appliances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the yard of the picturesque old building, half covered with ivy, with
      its mossy wheel slumbering amid water-lilies, they found the Lepailleurs,
      the man tall, dry, and carroty, the woman as carroty and as dry as
      himself, but both of them young and hardy. Their child Antonin was sitting
      on the ground, digging a hole with his little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eggs?&rdquo; La Lepailleur exclaimed; &ldquo;yes, certainly, madame, there must be
      some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no haste to fetch them, however, but stood looking at Gervais,
      who was asleep in his little vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so that&rsquo;s your last. He&rsquo;s plump and pretty enough, I must say,&rdquo; she
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lepailleur raised a derisive laugh, and with the familiarity which the
      peasant displays towards the bourgeois whom he knows to be hard up, he
      said: &ldquo;And so that makes you five, monsieur. Ah, well! that would be a
      deal too many for poor folks like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Mathieu quietly inquired. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got this mill, and don&rsquo;t you
      own fields, to give labor to the arms that would come and whose labor
      would double and treble your produce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These simple words were like a whipstroke that made Lepailleur rear. And
      once again he poured forth all his spite. Ah! surely now, it wasn&rsquo;t his
      tumble-down old mill that would ever enrich him, since it had enriched
      neither his father nor his grandfather. And as for his fields, well, that
      was a pretty dowry that his wife had brought him, land in which nothing
      more would grow, and which, however much one might water it with one&rsquo;s
      sweat, did not even pay for manuring and sowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the first place,&rdquo; resumed Mathieu, &ldquo;your mill ought to be repaired
      and its old mechanism replaced, or, better still, you should buy a good
      steam-engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repair the mill! Buy an engine! Why, that&rsquo;s madness,&rdquo; the other replied.
      &ldquo;What would be the use of it? As it is, people hereabouts have almost
      renounced growing corn, and I remain idle every other month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued Mathieu, &ldquo;if your fields yield less, it is because
      you cultivate them badly, following the old routine, without proper care
      or appliances or artificial manure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appliances! Artificial manure! All that humbug which has only sent poor
      folks to rack and ruin! Ah! I should just like to see you trying to
      cultivate the land better, and make it yield what it&rsquo;ll never yield any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he quite lost his temper, became violent and brutal, launching
      against the ungrateful earth all the charges which his love of idleness
      and his obstinacy suggested. He had travelled, he had fought in Africa as
      a soldier, folks could not say that he had always lived in his hole like
      an ignorant beast. But, none the less, on leaving his regiment he had lost
      all taste for work and come to the conclusion that agriculture was doomed,
      and would never give him aught but dry bread to eat. The land would soon
      be bankrupt, and the peasantry no longer believed in it, so old and empty
      and worn out had it become. And even the sun got out of order nowadays;
      they had snow in July and thunderstorms in December, a perfect upsetting
      of seasons, which wrecked the crops almost before they were out of the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; said Lepailleur, &ldquo;what you say is impossible; it&rsquo;s all
      past. The soil and work, there&rsquo;s nothing left of either. It&rsquo;s barefaced
      robbery, and though the peasant may kill himself with labor, he will soon
      be left without even water to drink. Children indeed! No, no! There&rsquo;s
      Antonin, of course, and for him we may just be able to provide. But I
      assure you that I won&rsquo;t even make Antonin a peasant against his will! If
      he takes to schooling and wishes to go to Paris, I shall tell him that
      he&rsquo;s quite right, for Paris is nowadays the only chance for sturdy chaps
      who want to make a fortune. So he will be at liberty to sell everything,
      if he chooses, and try his luck there. The only thing that I regret is
      that I didn&rsquo;t make the venture myself when there was still time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu began to laugh. Was it not singular that he, a bourgeois with a
      bachelor&rsquo;s degree and scientific attainments, should dream of coming back
      to the soil, to the common mother of all labor and wealth, when this
      peasant, sprung from peasants, cursed and insulted the earth, and hoped
      that his son would altogether renounce it? Never had anything struck him
      as more significant. It symbolized that disastrous exodus from the rural
      districts towards the towns, an exodus which year by year increased,
      unhinging the nation and reducing it to anaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; he said in a jovial way so as to drive all bitterness
      from the discussion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unfaithful to the earth; she&rsquo;s an old
      mistress who would revenge herself. In your place I would lay myself out
      to obtain from her, by increase of care, all that I might want. As in the
      world&rsquo;s early days, she is still the great fruitful spouse, and she yields
      abundantly when she is loved in proper fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lepailleur, raising his fists, retorted: &ldquo;No, no; I&rsquo;ve had enough of
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by the way,&rdquo; continued Mathieu, &ldquo;one thing which astonishes me is
      that no courageous, intelligent man has ever yet come forward to do
      something with all that vast abandoned estate yonder&mdash;that Chantebled&mdash;which
      old Seguin, formerly, dreamt of turning into a princely domain. There are
      great stretches of waste land, woods which one might partly fell, heaths
      and moorland which might easily be restored to cultivation. What a
      splendid task! What a work of creation for a bold man to undertake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This so amazed Lepailleur that he stood there openmouthed. Then his
      jeering spirit asserted itself: &ldquo;But, my dear sir&mdash;excuse my saying
      it&mdash;you must be mad! Cultivate Chantebled, clear those stony tracts,
      wade about in those marshes! Why, one might bury millions there without
      reaping a single bushel of oats! It&rsquo;s a cursed spot, which my
      grandfather&rsquo;s father saw such as it is now, and which my grandson&rsquo;s son
      will see just the same. Ah! well, I&rsquo;m not inquisitive, but it would really
      amuse me to meet the fool who might attempt such madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, who knows?&rdquo; Mathieu quietly concluded. &ldquo;When one only
      loves strongly one may work miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Lepailleur, after going to fetch a dozen eggs, now stood erect before
      her husband in admiration at hearing him talk so eloquently to a
      bourgeois. They agreed very well together in their avaricious rage at
      being unable to amass money by the handful without any great exertion, and
      in their ambition to make their son a gentleman, since only a gentleman
      could become wealthy. And thus, as Marianne was going off after placing
      the eggs under a cushion in Gervais&rsquo; little carriage, the other
      complacently called her attention to Antonin, who, having made a hole in
      the ground, was now spitting into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he knows his alphabet already, and we are
      going to put him to school. If he takes after his father he will be no
      fool, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on a Sunday, some ten days later, that the supreme revelation, the
      great flash of light which was to decide his life and that of those he
      loved, fell suddenly upon Mathieu during a walk he took with his wife and
      the children. They had gone out for the whole afternoon, taking a little
      snack with them in order that they might share it amid the long grass in
      the fields. And after scouring the paths, crossing the copses, rambling
      over the moorland, they came back to the verge of the woods and sat down
      under an oak. Thence the whole expanse spread out before them, from the
      little pavilion where they dwelt to the distant village of Janville. On
      their right was the great marshy plateau, from which broad, dry, sterile
      slopes descended; while lower ground stretched away on their left. Then,
      behind them, spread the woods with deep thickets parted by clearings, full
      of herbage which no scythe had ever touched. And not a soul was to be seen
      around them; there was naught save wild Nature, grandly quiescent under
      the bright sun of that splendid April day. The earth seemed to be dilating
      with all the sap amassed within it, and a flood of life could be felt
      rising and quivering in the vigorous trees, the spreading plants, and the
      impetuous growth of brambles and nettles which stretched invadingly over
      the soil. And on all sides a powerful, pungent odor was diffused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go too far,&rdquo; Marianne called to the children; &ldquo;we shall stay under
      this oak. We will have something to eat by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blaise and Denis were already bounding along, followed by Ambroise, to see
      who could run the fastest; but Rose pettishly called them back, for she
      preferred to play at gathering wild flowers. The open air fairly
      intoxicated the youngsters; the herbage rose, here and there, to their
      very shoulders. But they came back and gathered flowers; and after a time
      they set off at a wild run once more, one of the big brothers carrying the
      little sister on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, however, had remained absent-minded, with his eyes wandering
      hither and thither, throughout their walk. At times he did not hear
      Marianne when she spoke to him; he lapsed into reverie before some
      uncultivated tract, some copse overrun with brushwood, some spring which
      suddenly bubbled up and was then lost in mire. Nevertheless, she felt that
      there was no sadness nor feeling of indifference in his heart; for as soon
      as he returned to her he laughed once more with his soft, loving laugh. It
      was she who often sent him roaming about the country, even alone, for she
      felt that it would do him good; and although she had guessed that
      something very serious was passing through his mind, she retained full
      confidence, waiting till it should please him to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, just as he had sunk once more into his reverie, his glance
      wandering afar, studying the great varied expanse of land, she raised a
      light cry: &ldquo;Oh! look, look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the big oak tree she had placed Master Gervais in his little
      carriage, among wild weeds which hid its wheels. And while she handed a
      little silver mug, from which it was intended they should drink while
      taking their snack, she had noticed that the child raised his head and
      followed the movement of her hand, in which the silver sparkled beneath
      the sun-rays. Forthwith she repeated the experiment, and again the child&rsquo;s
      eyes followed the starry gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it can&rsquo;t be said that I&rsquo;m mistaken, and am simply fancying it!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;It is certain that he can see quite plainly now. My pretty
      pet, my little darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She darted to the child to kiss him in celebration of that first clear
      glance. And then, too, came the delight of the first smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look!&rdquo; in his turn said Mathieu, who was leaning over the child
      beside her, yielding to the same feeling of rapture, &ldquo;there he is smiling
      at you now. But of course, as soon as these little fellows see clearly
      they begin to laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She herself burst into a laugh. &ldquo;You are right, he is laughing! Ah! how
      funny he looks, and how happy I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both father and mother laughed together with content at the sight of that
      infantile smile, vague and fleeting, like a faint ripple on the pure water
      of some spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this joy Marianne called the four others, who were bounding under the
      young foliage around them: &ldquo;Come, Rose! come, Ambroise! come, Blaise and
      Denis! It&rsquo;s time now; come at once to have something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hastened up and the snack was set out on a patch of soft grass.
      Mathieu unhooked the basket which hung in front of the baby&rsquo;s little
      vehicle; and Marianne, having drawn some slices of bread-and-butter from
      it, proceeded to distribute them. Perfect silence ensued while all four
      children began biting with hearty appetite, which it was a pleasure to
      see. But all at once a scream arose. It came from Master Gervais, who was
      vexed at not having been served first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, it&rsquo;s true I was forgetting you,&rdquo; said Marianne gayly; &ldquo;you shall
      have your share. There, open your mouth, you darling;&rdquo; and, with an easy,
      simple gesture, she unfastened her dress-body; and then, under the
      sunlight which steeped her in golden radiance, in full view of the
      far-spreading countryside, where all likewise was bare&mdash;the soil, the
      trees, the plants, streaming with sap&mdash;having seated herself in the
      long grass, where she almost disappeared amid the swarming growth of
      April&rsquo;s germs, the babe on her breast eagerly sucked in her warm milk,
      even as all the encompassing verdure was sucking life from the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hungry you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pinch me so hard, you little
      glutton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mathieu had remained standing amid the enchantment of the child&rsquo;s
      first smile and the gayety born of the hearty hunger around him. Then his
      dream of creation came back to him, and he at last gave voice to those
      plans for the future which haunted him, and of which he had so far spoken
      to nobody: &ldquo;Ah, well, it is high time that I should set to work and found
      a kingdom, if these children are to have enough soup to make them grow.
      Shall I tell you what I&rsquo;ve thought&mdash;shall I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne raised her eyes, smiling and all attention. &ldquo;Yes, tell me your
      secret if the time has come. Oh! I could guess that you had some great
      hope in you. But I did not ask you anything; I preferred to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not give a direct reply, for at a sudden recollection his feelings
      rebelled. &ldquo;That Lepailleur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is simply a lazy fellow and a fool
      in spite of all his cunning airs. Can there be any more sacrilegious folly
      than to imagine that the earth has lost her fruitfulness and is becoming
      bankrupt&mdash;she, the eternal mother, eternal life? She only shows
      herself a bad mother to her bad sons, the malicious, the obstinate, and
      the dull-witted, who do not know how to love and cultivate her. But if an
      intelligent son comes and devotes himself to her, and works her with the
      help of experience and all the new systems of science, you will soon see
      her quicken and yield tremendous harvests unceasingly. Ah! folks say in
      the district that this estate of Chantebled has never yielded and never
      will yield anything but nettles. Well, nevertheless, a man will come who
      will transform it and make it a new land of joy and abundance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly turning round, with outstretched arm, and pointing to the
      spots to which he referred in turn, he went on: &ldquo;Yonder in the rear there
      are nearly five hundred acres of little woods, stretching as far as the
      farms of Mareuil and Lillebonne. They are separated by clearings of
      excellent soil which broad gaps unite, and which could easily be turned
      into good pastures, for there are numerous springs. And, indeed, the
      springs become so abundant on the right, that they have changed that big
      plateau into a kind of marshland, dotted with ponds, and planted with
      reeds and rushes. But picture a man of bold mind, a clearer, a conqueror,
      who should drain those lands and rid them of superfluous water by means of
      a few canals which might easily be dug! Why, then a huge stretch of land
      would be reclaimed, handed over to cultivation, and wheat would grow there
      with extraordinary vigor. But that is not all. There is the expanse before
      us, those gentle slopes from Janville to Vieux-Bourg, that is another five
      hundred acres, which are left almost uncultivated on account of their
      dryness, the stony poverty of their soil. So it is all very simple. One
      would merely have to take the sources up yonder, the waters, now stagnant,
      and carry them across those sterile slopes, which, when irrigated, would
      gradually develop extraordinary fertility. I have seen everything, I have
      studied everything. I feel that there are at least twelve hundred acres of
      land which a bold creator might turn into a most productive estate. Yonder
      lies a whole kingdom of corn, a whole new world to be created by labor,
      with the help of the beneficent waters and our father the sun, the source
      of eternal life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne gazed at him and admired him as he stood there quivering,
      pondering over all that he evoked from his dream. But she was frightened
      by the vastness of such hopes, and could not restrain a cry of disquietude
      and prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that is too much; you desire the impossible. How can you think
      that we shall ever possess so much&mdash;that our fortune will spread over
      the entire region? Think of the capital, the arms that would be needed for
      such a conquest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mathieu remained silent on thus suddenly being brought back
      to reality. Then with his affectionate, sensible air, he began to laugh.
      &ldquo;You are right; I have been dreaming and talking wildly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
      am not yet so ambitious as to wish to be King of Chantebled. But there is
      truth in what I have said to you; and, besides, what harm can there be in
      dreaming of great plans to give oneself faith and courage? Meantime I
      intend to try cultivating just a few acres, which Seguin will no doubt
      sell me cheaply enough, together with the little pavilion in which we
      live. I know that the unproductiveness of the estate weighs on him. And,
      later on, we shall see if the earth is disposed to love us and come to us
      as we go to her. Ah well, my dear, give that little glutton plenty of
      life, and you, my darlings, eat and drink and grow in strength, for the
      earth belongs to those who are healthy and numerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blaise and Denis made answer by taking some fresh slices of
      bread-and-butter, while Rose drained the mug of wine and water which
      Ambroise handed her. And Marianne sat there like the symbol of blossoming
      Fruitfulness, the source of vigor and conquest, while Gervais heartily
      nursed on. He pulled so hard, indeed, that one could hear the sound of his
      lips. It was like the faint noise which attends the rise of a spring&mdash;a
      slender rill of milk that is to swell and become a river. Around her the
      mother heard that source springing up and spreading on all sides. She was
      not nourishing alone: the sap of April was dilating the land, sending a
      quiver through the woods, raising the long herbage which embowered her.
      And beneath her, from the bosom of the earth, which was ever in travail,
      she felt that flood of sap reaching and ever pervading her. And it was
      like a stream of milk flowing through the world, a stream of eternal life
      for humanity&rsquo;s eternal crop. And on that gay day of spring the dazzling,
      singing, fragrant countryside was steeped in it all, triumphal with that
      beauty of the mother, who, in the full light of the sun, in view of the
      vast horizon, sat there nursing her child.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the morrow, after a morning&rsquo;s hard toil at his office at the works,
      Mathieu, having things well advanced, bethought himself of going to see
      Norine at Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s. He knew that she had given birth to a child a
      fortnight previously, and he wished to ascertain the exact state of
      affairs, in order to carry to an end the mission with which Beauchene had
      intrusted him. As the other, however, had never again spoken to him on the
      subject, he simply told him that he was going out in the afternoon,
      without indicating the motive of his absence. At the same time he knew
      what secret relief Beauchene would experience when he at last learnt that
      the whole business was at an end&mdash;the child cast adrift and the
      mother following her own course.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the Rue de Miromesnil, Mathieu had to go up to Norine&rsquo;s room,
      for though she was to leave the house on the following Thursday, she still
      kept her bed. And at the foot of the bedstead, asleep in a cradle, he was
      surprised to see the infant, of which, he thought, she had already rid
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it you?&rdquo; she joyously exclaimed. &ldquo;I was about to write to you, for
      I wanted to see you before going away. My little sister here would have
      taken you the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecile Moineaud was indeed there, together with the younger girl, Irma.
      The mother, unable to absent herself from her household duties, had sent
      them to make inquiries, and give Norine three big oranges, which glistened
      on the table beside the bed. The little girls had made the journey on
      foot, greatly interested by all the sights of the streets and the displays
      in the shop-windows. And now they were enraptured with the fine house in
      which they found their big sister sojourning, and full of curiosity with
      respect to the baby which slept under the cradle&rsquo;s muslin curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu made the usual inquiries of Norine, who answered him gayly, but
      pouted somewhat at the prospect of having so soon to leave the house,
      where she had found herself so comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t easily find such soft mattresses and such good food, eh,
      Victoire?&rdquo; she asked. Whereupon Mathieu perceived that another girl was
      present, a pale little creature with wavy red hair, tip-tilted nose, and
      long mouth, whom he had already seen there on the occasion of a previous
      visit. She slept in one of the two other beds which the room contained,
      and now sat beside it mending some linen. She was to leave the house on
      the morrow, having already sent her child to the Foundling Hospital; and
      in the meantime she was mending some things for Rosine, the well-to-do
      young person of great beauty whom Mathieu had previously espied, and whose
      story, according to Norine, was so sadly pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victoire ceased sewing and raised her head. She was a servant girl by
      calling, one of those unlucky creatures who are overtaken by trouble when
      they have scarce arrived in the great city from their native village.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite certain that one won&rsquo;t be able to dawdle in
      bed, and that one won&rsquo;t have warm milk given one to drink before getting
      up. But, all the same, it isn&rsquo;t lively to see nothing but that big gray
      wall yonder from the window. And, besides, one can&rsquo;t go on forever doing
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine laughed and jerked her head, as if she were not of this opinion.
      Then, as her little sisters embarrassed her, she wished to get rid of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, my pussies,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you say that papa&rsquo;s still angry with me,
      and that I&rsquo;m not to go back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Cecile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so much that he&rsquo;s angry, but he says that
      all the neighbors would point their fingers at him if he let you come
      home. Besides, Euphrasie keeps his anger up, particularly since she&rsquo;s
      arranged to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Euphrasie going to be married? You didn&rsquo;t tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine looked very vexed, particularly when her sisters, speaking both
      together, told her that the future husband was Auguste Benard, a jovial
      young mason who lived on the floor above them. He had taken a fancy to
      Euphrasie, though she had no good looks, and was as thin, at eighteen, as
      a grasshopper. Doubtless, however, he considered her strong and
      hard-working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much good may it do them!&rdquo; said Norine spitefully. &ldquo;Why, with her evil
      temper, she&rsquo;ll be beating him before six months are over. You can just
      tell mamma that I don&rsquo;t care a rap for any of you, and that I need nobody.
      I&rsquo;ll go and look for work, and I&rsquo;ll find somebody to help me. So, you
      hear, don&rsquo;t you come back here. I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered by you any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Irma, but eight years old and tender-hearted, began to cry. &ldquo;Why
      do you scold us? We didn&rsquo;t come to worry you. I wanted to ask you, too, if
      that baby&rsquo;s yours, and if we may kiss it before we go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine immediately regretted her spiteful outburst. She once more called
      the girls her &ldquo;little pussies,&rdquo; kissed them tenderly, and told them that
      although they must run away now they might come back another day to see
      her if it amused them. &ldquo;Thank mamma from me for her oranges. And as for
      the baby, well, you may look at it, but you mustn&rsquo;t touch it, for if it
      woke up we shouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the two children leant inquisitively over the cradle, Mathieu
      also glanced at it, and saw a healthy, sturdy-looking child, with a square
      face and strong features. And it seemed to him that the infant was
      singularly like Beauchene.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, however, Madame Bourdieu came in, accompanied by a woman,
      whom he recognized as Sophie Couteau, &ldquo;La Couteau,&rdquo; that nurse-agent whom
      he had seen at the Seguins&rsquo; one day when she had gone thither to offer to
      procure them a nurse. She also certainly recognized this gentleman, whose
      wife, proud of being able to suckle her own children, had evinced such
      little inclination to help others to do business. She pretended, however,
      that she saw him for the first time; for she was discreet by profession
      and not even inquisitive, since so many matters were ever coming to her
      knowledge without the asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Cecile and little Irma went off at once; and then Madame Bourdieu,
      addressing Norine, inquired: &ldquo;Well, my child, have you thought it over;
      have you quite made up your mind about that poor little darling, who is
      sleeping there so prettily? Here is the person I spoke to you about. She
      comes from Normandy every fortnight, bringing nurses to Paris; and each
      time she takes babies away with her to put them out to nurse in the
      country. Though you say you won&rsquo;t feed it, you surely need not cast off
      your child altogether; you might confide it to this person until you are
      in a position to take it back. Or else, if you have made up your mind to
      abandon it altogether, she will kindly take it to the Foundling Hospital
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great perturbation had come over Norine, who let her head fall back on her
      pillow, over which streamed her thick fair hair, whilst her face darkened
      and she stammered: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, <i>mon Dieu</i>! you are going to
      worry me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she pressed her hands to her eyes as if anxious to see nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what the regulations require of me, monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame
      Bourdieu to Mathieu in an undertone, while leaving the young mother for a
      moment to her reflections. &ldquo;We are recommended to do all we can to
      persuade our boarders, especially when they are situated like this one, to
      nurse their infants. You are aware that this often saves not only the
      child, but the mother herself, from the sad future which threatens her.
      And so, however much she may wish to abandon the child, we leave it near
      her as long as possible, and feed it with the bottle, in the hope that the
      sight of the poor little creature may touch her heart and awaken feelings
      of motherliness in her. Nine times out of ten, as soon as she gives the
      child the breast, she is vanquished, and she keeps it. That is why you
      still see this baby here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, feeling greatly moved, drew near to Norine, who still lay back
      amid her streaming hair, with her hands pressed to her face. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;you are a goodhearted girl, there is no malice in you. Why not
      yourself keep that dear little fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she uncovered her burning, tearless face: &ldquo;Did the father even come
      to see me?&rdquo; she asked bitterly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t love the child of a man who has
      behaved as he has! The mere thought that it&rsquo;s there, in that cradle, puts
      me in a rage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that dear little innocent isn&rsquo;t guilty. It&rsquo;s he whom you condemn,
      yourself whom you punish, for now you will be quite alone, and he might
      prove a great consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I tell you no, I won&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t keep a child like that with nobody to
      help me. We all know what we can do, don&rsquo;t we? Well, it is of no use my
      questioning myself. I&rsquo;m not brave enough, I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to do such
      a thing. No, no, and no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more, for he realized that nothing would prevail over that
      thirst for liberty which she felt in the depths of her being. With a
      gesture he expressed his sadness, but he was neither indignant nor angry
      with her, for others had made her what she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s understood, you won&rsquo;t be forced to feed it,&rdquo; resumed Madame
      Bourdieu, attempting a final effort. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t praiseworthy to abandon
      the child. Why not trust it to Madame here, who would put it out to nurse,
      so that you would be able to take it back some day, when you have found
      work? It wouldn&rsquo;t cost much, and no doubt the father would pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Norine flew into a passion. &ldquo;He! pay? Ah! you don&rsquo;t know him.
      It&rsquo;s not that the money would inconvenience him, for he&rsquo;s a millionnaire.
      But all he wants is to see the little one disappear. If he had dared he
      would have told me to kill it! Just ask that gentleman if I speak the
      truth. You see that he keeps silent! And how am I to pay when I haven&rsquo;t a
      copper, when to-morrow I shall be cast out-of-doors, perhaps, without work
      and without bread. No, no, a thousand times no, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, overcome by an hysterical fit of despair, she burst into sobs. &ldquo;I
      beg you, leave me in peace. For the last fortnight you have been torturing
      me with that child, by keeping him near me, with the idea that I should
      end by nursing him. You bring him to me, and set him on my knees, so that
      I may look at him and kiss him. You are always worrying me with him, and
      making him cry with the hope that I shall pity him and take him to my
      breast. But, <i>mon Dieu</i>! can&rsquo;t you understand that if I turn my head
      away, if I don&rsquo;t want to kiss him or even to see him, it is because I&rsquo;m
      afraid of being caught and loving him like a big fool, which would be a
      great misfortune both for him and for me? He&rsquo;ll be far happier by himself!
      So, I beg you, let him be taken away at once, and don&rsquo;t torture me any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobbing violently, she again sank back in bed, and buried her dishevelled
      head in the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau had remained waiting, mute and motionless, at the foot of the
      bedstead. In her gown of dark woollen stuff and her black cap trimmed with
      yellow ribbons she retained the air of a peasant woman in her Sunday best.
      And she strove to impart an expression of compassionate good-nature to her
      long, avaricious, false face. Although it seemed to her unlikely that
      business would ensue, she risked a repetition of her customary speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Rougemont, you know, madame, your little one would be just the same as
      at home. There&rsquo;s no better air in the Department; people come there from
      Bayeux to recruit their health. And if you only knew how well the little
      ones are cared for! It&rsquo;s the only occupation of the district, to have
      little Parisians to coddle and love! And, besides, I wouldn&rsquo;t charge you
      dear. I&rsquo;ve a friend of mine who already has three nurslings, and, as she
      naturally brings them up with the bottle, it wouldn&rsquo;t put her out to take
      a fourth for almost next to nothing. Come, doesn&rsquo;t that suit you&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
      that tempt you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, however, she saw that tears were Norine&rsquo;s only answer, she made an
      impatient gesture like an active woman who cannot afford to lose her time.
      At each of her fortnightly journeys, as soon as she had rid herself of her
      batch of nurses at the different offices, she hastened round the nurses&rsquo; 
      establishments to pick up infants, so as to take the train homewards the
      same evening together with two or three women who, as she put it, helped
      her &ldquo;to cart the little ones about.&rdquo; On this occasion she was in a greater
      hurry, as Madame Bourdieu, who employed her in a variety of ways, had
      asked her to take Norine&rsquo;s child to the Foundling Hospital if she did not
      take it to Rougemont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said La Couteau, turning to Madame Bourdieu, &ldquo;I shall have only
      the other lady&rsquo;s child to take back with me. Well, I had better see her at
      once to make final arrangements. Then I&rsquo;ll take this one and carry it
      yonder as fast as possible, for my train starts at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When La Couteau and Madame Bourdieu had gone off to speak to Rosine, who
      was the &ldquo;other lady&rdquo; referred to, the room sank into silence save for the
      wailing and sobbing of Norine. Mathieu had seated himself near the cradle,
      gazing compassionately at the poor little babe, who was still peacefully
      sleeping. Soon, however, Victoire, the little servant girl, who had
      hitherto remained silent, as if absorbed in her sewing, broke the heavy
      silence and talked on slowly and interminably without raising her eyes
      from her needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right in not trusting your child to that horrid woman!&rdquo;
       she began. &ldquo;Whatever may be done with him at the hospital, he will be
      better off there than in her hands. At least he will have a chance to
      live. And that&rsquo;s why I insisted, like you, on having mine taken there at
      once. You know I belong in that woman&rsquo;s region&mdash;yes, I come from
      Berville, which is barely four miles from Rougemont, and I can&rsquo;t help
      knowing La Couteau, for folks talk enough about her in our village. She&rsquo;s
      a nice creature and no mistake! And it&rsquo;s a fine trade that she plies,
      selling other people&rsquo;s milk. She was no better than she should be at one
      time, but at last she was lucky enough to marry a big, coarse, brutal
      fellow, whom at this time of day she leads by the nose. And he helps her.
      Yes, he also brings nurses to Paris and takes babies back with him, at
      busy times. But between them they have more murders on their consciences
      than all the assassins that have ever been guillotined. The mayor of
      Berville, a bourgeois who&rsquo;s retired from business and a worthy man, said
      that Rougemont was the curse of the Department. I know well enough that
      there&rsquo;s always been some rivalry between Rougemont and Berville; but, the
      folks of Rougemont ply a wicked trade with the babies they get from Paris.
      All the inhabitants have ended by taking to it, there&rsquo;s nothing else doing
      in the whole village, and you should just see how things are arranged so
      that there may be as many funerals as possible. Ah! yes, people don&rsquo;t keep
      their stock-in-trade on their hands. The more that die, the more they
      earn. And so one can understand that La Couteau always wants to take back
      as many babies as possible at each journey she makes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victoire recounted these dreadful things in her simple way, as one whom
      Paris has not yet turned into a liar, and who says all she knows, careless
      what it may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it seems things were far worse years ago,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I have
      heard my father say that, in his time, the agents would bring back four or
      five children at one journey&mdash;perfect parcels of babies, which they
      tied together and carried under their arms. They set them out in rows on
      the seats in the waiting-rooms at the station; and one day, indeed, a
      Rougemont agent forgot one child in a waiting-room, and there was quite a
      row about it, because when the child was found again it was dead. And then
      you should have seen in the trains what a heap of poor little things there
      was, all crying with hunger. It became pitiable in winter time, when there
      was snow and frost, for they were all shivering and blue with cold in
      their scanty, ragged swaddling-clothes. One or another often died on the
      way, and then it was removed at the next station and buried in the nearest
      cemetery. And you can picture what a state those who didn&rsquo;t die were in.
      At our place we care better for our pigs, for we certainly wouldn&rsquo;t send
      them travelling in that fashion. My father used to say that it was enough
      to make the very stones weep. Nowadays, however, there&rsquo;s more supervision;
      the regulations allow the agents to take only one nursling back at a time.
      But they know all sorts of tricks, and often take a couple. And then, too,
      they make arrangements; they have women who help them, and they avail
      themselves of those who may be going back into the country alone. Yes, La
      Couteau has all sorts of tricks to evade the law. And, besides, all the
      folks of Rougemont close their eyes&mdash;they are too much interested in
      keeping business brisk; and all they fear is that the police may poke
      their noses into their affairs. Ah! it is all very well for the Government
      to send inspectors every month, and insist on registers, and the Mayor&rsquo;s
      signature and the stamp of the Commune; why, it&rsquo;s just as if it did
      nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t prevent these women from quietly plying their trade
      and sending as many little ones as they can to kingdom-come. We&rsquo;ve got a
      cousin at Rougemont who said to us one day: &lsquo;La Malivoire&rsquo;s precious
      lucky, she got rid of four more during last month.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victoire paused for a moment to thread her needle. Norine was still
      weeping, while Mathieu listened, mute with horror, and with his eyes fixed
      upon the sleeping child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt folks say less about Rougemont nowadays than they used to,&rdquo; the
      girl resumed; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s still enough to disgust one. We know three or
      four baby-farmers who are not worth their salt. The rule is to bring the
      little ones up with the bottle, you know; and you&rsquo;d be horrified if you
      saw what bottles they are&mdash;never cleaned, always filthy, with the
      milk inside them icy cold in the winter and sour in the summer. La Vimeux,
      for her part, thinks that the bottle system costs too much, and so she
      feeds her children on soup. That clears them off all the quicker. At La
      Loiseau&rsquo;s you have to hold your nose when you go near the corner where the
      little ones sleep&mdash;their rags are so filthy. As for La Gavette, she&rsquo;s
      always working in the fields with her man, so that the three or four
      nurslings that she generally has are left in charge of the grandfather, an
      old cripple of seventy, who can&rsquo;t even prevent the fowls from coming to
      peck at the little ones.* And things are worse even at La Cauchois&rsquo;, for,
      as she has nobody at all to mind the children when she goes out working,
      she leaves them tied in their cradles, for fear lest they should tumble
      out and crack their skulls. You might visit all the houses in the village,
      and you would find the same thing everywhere. There isn&rsquo;t a house where
      the trade isn&rsquo;t carried on. Round our part there are places where folks
      make lace, or make cheese, or make cider; but at Rougemont they only make
      dead bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * There is no exaggeration in what M. Zola writes on this subject.
    I have even read in French Government reports of instances in
    which nurslings have been devoured by pigs! And it is a well-known
    saying in France that certain Norman and Touraine villages are
    virtually &ldquo;paved with little Parisians.&rdquo;&mdash;Trans.
</pre>
    <p>
      All at once she ceased sewing, and looked at Mathieu with her timid, clear
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the worst of all,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is La Couillard, an old thief who
      once did six months in prison, and who now lives a little way out of the
      village on the verge of the wood. No live child has ever left La
      Couillard&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s her specialty. When you see an agent, like La Couteau,
      for instance, taking her a child, you know at once what&rsquo;s in the wind. La
      Couteau has simply bargained that the little one shall die. It&rsquo;s settled
      in a very easy fashion: the parents give a sum of three or four hundred
      francs on condition that the little one shall be kept till his first
      communion, and you may be quite certain that he dies within a week. It&rsquo;s
      only necessary to leave a window open near him, as a nurse used to do whom
      my father knew. At winter time, when she had half a dozen babies in her
      house, she would set the door wide open and then go out for a stroll. And,
      by the way, that little boy in the next room, whom La Couteau has just
      gone to see, she&rsquo;ll take him to La Couillard&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure; for I heard the
      mother, Mademoiselle Rosine, agree with her the other day to give her a
      sum of four hundred francs down on the understanding that she should have
      nothing more to do in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Victoire ceased speaking, for La Couteau came in to fetch
      Norine&rsquo;s child. Norine, who had emerged from her distress during the
      servant girl&rsquo;s stories, had ended by listening to them with great
      interest. But directly she perceived the agent she once more hid her face
      in her pillows, as though she feared to see what was about to happen.
      Mathieu, on his side, had risen from his chair and stood there quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s understood, I&rsquo;m going to take the child,&rdquo; said La Couteau.
      &ldquo;Madame Bourdieu has given me a slip of paper bearing the date of the
      birth and the address. Only I ought to have some Christian names. What do
      you wish the child to be called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine did not at first answer. Then, in a faint distressful voice, she
      said: &ldquo;Alexandre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandre, very well. But you would do better to give the boy a second
      Christian name, so as to identify him the more readily, if some day you
      take it into your head to run after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was again necessary to tear a reply from Norine. &ldquo;Honore,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandre Honore&mdash;all right. That last name is yours, is it not?*
      And the first is the father&rsquo;s? That is settled; and now I&rsquo;ve everything I
      need. Only it&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock already, and I shall never get back in time
      for the six o&rsquo;clock train if I don&rsquo;t take a cab. It&rsquo;s such a long way off&mdash;the
      other side of the Luxembourg. And a cab costs money. How shall we manage?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * Norine is, of course, a diminutive of Honorine, which is the
    feminine form of Honore.&mdash;Trans.
</pre>
    <p>
      While she continued whining, to see if she could not extract a few francs
      from the distressed girl, it suddenly occurred to Mathieu to carry out his
      mission to the very end by driving with her himself to the Foundling
      Hospital, so that he might be in a position to inform Beauchene that the
      child had really been deposited there, in his presence. So he told La
      Couteau that he would go down with her, take a cab, and bring her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; that will suit me. Let us be off! It&rsquo;s a pity to wake the
      little one, since he&rsquo;s so sound asleep; but all the same, we must pack him
      off, since it&rsquo;s decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her dry hands, which were used to handling goods of this description,
      she caught up the child, perhaps, however, a little roughly, forgetting
      her assumed wheedling good nature now that she was simply charged with
      conveying it to hospital. And the child awoke and began to scream loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dear me, it won&rsquo;t be amusing if he keeps up this music in the cab.
      Quick, let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu stopped her. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss him, Norine?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very first squeal that sorry mother had dipped yet lower under her
      sheets, carrying her hands to her ears, distracted as she was by the sound
      of those cries. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;take him away; take him away at
      once. Don&rsquo;t begin torturing me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed her eyes, and with one arm repulsed the child who seemed
      to be pursuing her. But when she felt that the agent was laying him on the
      bed, she suddenly shuddered, sat up, and gave a wild hasty kiss, which
      lighted on the little fellow&rsquo;s cap. She had scarcely opened her
      tear-dimmed eyes, and could have seen but a vague phantom of that poor
      feeble creature, wailing and struggling at the decisive moment when he was
      being cast into the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are killing me! Take him away; take him away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in the cab the child suddenly became silent. Either the jolting of
      the vehicle calmed him, or the creaking of the wheels filled him with
      emotion. La Couteau, who kept him on her knees, at first remained silent,
      as if interested in the people on the footwalks, where the bright sun was
      shining. Then, all of a sudden, she began to talk, venting her thoughts
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little woman made a great mistake in not trusting the child to me. I
      should have put him out to nurse properly, and he would have grown up
      finely at Rougemont. But there! they all imagine that we simply worry them
      because we want to do business. But I just ask you, if she had given me
      five francs for myself and paid my return journey, would that have ruined
      her? A pretty girl like her oughtn&rsquo;t to be hard up for money. I know very
      well that in our calling there are some people who are hardly honest, who
      speculate and ask for commissions, and then put out nurslings at cheap
      rates and rob both the parents and the nurse. It&rsquo;s really not right to
      treat these dear little things as if they were goods&mdash;poultry or
      vegetables. When folks do that I can understand that their hearts get
      hardened, and that they pass the little ones on from hand to hand without
      any more care than if they were stock-in-trade. But then, monsieur, I&rsquo;m an
      honest woman; I&rsquo;m authorized by the mayor of our village; I hold a
      certificate of morality, which I can show to anybody. If ever you should
      come to Rougemont, just ask after Sophie Couteau there. Folks will tell
      you that I&rsquo;m a hard-working woman, and don&rsquo;t owe a copper to a soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu could not help looking at her to see how unblushingly she thus
      praised herself. And her speech struck him as if it were a premeditated
      reply to all that Victoire had related of her, for, with the keen scent of
      a shrewd peasant woman, she must have guessed that charges had been
      brought against her. When she felt that his piercing glance was diving to
      her very soul, she doubtless feared that she had not lied with sufficient
      assurance, and had somehow negligently betrayed herself; for she did not
      insist, but put on more gentleness of manner, and contented herself with
      praising Rougemont in a general way, saying what a perfect paradise it
      was, where the little ones were received, fed, cared for, and coddled as
      if they were all sons of princes. Then, seeing that the gentleman uttered
      never a word, she became silent once more. It was evidently useless to try
      to win him over. And meantime the cab rolled and rolled along; streets
      followed streets, ever noisy and crowded; and they crossed the Seine and
      at last drew near to the Luxembourg. It was only after passing the palace
      gardens that La Couteau again began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s that young person&rsquo;s own affair if she imagines that her child
      will be better off for passing through the Foundling. I don&rsquo;t attack the
      Administration, but you know, monsieur, there&rsquo;s a good deal to be said on
      the matter. At Rougemont we have a number of nurslings that it sends us,
      and they don&rsquo;t grow any better or die less frequently than the others.
      Well, well, people are free to act as they fancy; but all the same I
      should like you to know, as I do, all that goes on in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cab had stopped at the top of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau, at a short
      distance from the former outer Boulevard. A big gray wall stretched out,
      the frigid facade of a State establishment, and it was through a quiet,
      simple, unobtrusive little doorway at the end of this wall that La Couteau
      went in with the child. Mathieu followed her, but he did not enter the
      office where a woman received the children. He felt too much emotion, and
      feared lest he should be questioned; it was, indeed, as if he considered
      himself an accomplice in a crime. Though La Couteau told him that the
      woman would ask him nothing, and the strictest secrecy was always
      observed, he preferred to wait in an anteroom, which led to several closed
      compartments, where the persons who came to deposit children were placed
      to wait their turn. And he watched the woman go off, carrying the little
      one, who still remained extremely well behaved, with a vacant stare in his
      big eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the interval of waiting could not have lasted more than twenty
      minutes, it seemed terribly long to Mathieu. Lifeless quietude reigned in
      that stern, sad-looking anteroom, wainscoted with oak, and pervaded with
      the smell peculiar to hospitals. All he heard was the occasional faint
      wail of some infant, above which now and then rose a heavy, restrained
      sob, coming perhaps from some mother who was waiting in one of the
      adjoining compartments. And he recalled the &ldquo;slide&rdquo; of other days, the box
      which turned within the wall. The mother crept up, concealing herself much
      as possible from view, thrust her baby into the cavity as into an oven,
      gave a tug at the bell-chain, and then precipitately fled. Mathieu was too
      young to have seen the real thing; he had only seen it represented in a
      melodrama at the Port St. Martin Theatre.* But how many stories it
      recalled&mdash;hampers of poor little creatures brought up from the
      provinces and deposited at the hospital by carriers; the stolen babes of
      Duchesses, here cast into oblivion by suspicious-looking men; the hundreds
      of wretched work-girls too who had here rid themselves of their
      unfortunate children. Now, however, the children had to be deposited
      openly, and there was a staff which took down names and dates, while
      giving a pledge of inviolable secrecy. Mathieu was aware that some few
      people imputed to the suppression of the slide system the great increase
      in criminal offences. But each day public opinion condemns more and more
      the attitude of society in former times, and discards the idea that one
      must accept evil, dam it in, and hide it as if it were some necessary
      sewer; for the only course for a free community to pursue is to foresee
      evil and grapple with it, and destroy it in the bud. To diminish the
      number of cast-off children one must seek out the mothers, encourage them,
      succor them, and give them the means to be mothers in fact as well as in
      name. At that moment, however, Mathieu did not reason; it was his heart
      that was affected, filled with growing pity and anguish at the thought of
      all the crime, all the shame, all the grief and distress that had passed
      through that anteroom in which he stood. What terrible confessions must
      have been heard, what a procession of suffering, ignominy, and
      wretchedness must have been witnessed by that woman who received the
      children in her mysterious little office! To her all the wreckage of the
      slums, all the woe lying beneath gilded life, all the abominations, all
      the tortures that remain unknown, were carried. There in her office was
      the port for the shipwrecked, there the black hole that swallowed up the
      offspring of frailty and shame. And while Mathieu&rsquo;s spell of waiting
      continued he saw three poor creatures arrive at the hospital. One was
      surely a work-girl, delicate and pretty though she looked, so thin, so
      pale too, and with so wild an air that he remembered a paragraph he had
      lately read in a newspaper, recounting how another such girl, after
      forsaking her child, had thrown herself into the river. The second seemed
      to him to be a married woman, some workman&rsquo;s wife, no doubt, overburdened
      with children and unable to provide food for another mouth; while the
      third was tall, strong, and insolent,&mdash;one of those who bring three
      or four children to the hospital one after the other. And all three women
      plunged in, and he heard them being penned in separate compartments by an
      attendant, while he, with stricken heart, realizing how heavily fate fell
      on some, still stood there waiting.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * The &ldquo;slide&rdquo; system, which enabled a mother to deposit her child
    at the hospital without being seen by those within, ceased to be
    employed officially as far back as 1847; but the apparatus was
    long preserved intact, and I recollect seeing it in the latter
    years of the Second Empire, <i>cir.</i> 1867-70, when I was often at
    the artists&rsquo; studios in the neighborhood. The aperture through
    which children were deposited in the sliding-box was close to
    the little door of which M. Zola speaks.&mdash;Trans.
</pre>
    <p>
      When La Couteau at last reappeared with empty arms she said never a word,
      and Mathieu put no question to her. Still in silence, they took their
      seats in the cab; and only some ten minutes afterwards, when the vehicle
      was already rolling through bustling, populous streets, did the woman
      begin to laugh. Then, as her companion, still silent and distant, did not
      condescend to ask her the cause of her sudden gayety, she ended by saying
      aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I am laughing? If I kept you waiting a bit longer, it was
      because I met a friend of mine, an attendant in the house, just as I left
      the office. She&rsquo;s one of those who put the babies out to nurse in the
      provinces.* Well, my friend told me that she was going to Rougemont
      to-morrow with two other attendants, and that among others they would
      certainly have with them the little fellow I had just left at the
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * There are only about 600 beds at the Hopital des Enfants
    Assistes, and the majority of the children deposited there
    are perforce placed out to purse in the country.&mdash;Trans.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again did she give vent to a dry laugh which distorted her wheedling face.
      And she continued: &ldquo;How comical, eh? The mother wouldn&rsquo;t let me take the
      child to Rougemont, and now it&rsquo;s going there just the same. Ah! some
      things are bound to happen in spite of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu did not answer, but an icy chill had sped through his heart. It
      was true, fate pitilessly took its own course. What would become of that
      poor little fellow? To what early death, what life of suffering or
      wretchedness, or even crime, had he been thus brutally cast?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cab continued rolling on, and for a long while neither Mathieu nor
      La Couteau spoke again. It was only when the latter alighted in the Rue de
      Miromesnil that she began to lament, on seeing that it was already
      half-past five o&rsquo;clock, for she felt certain that she would miss her
      train, particularly as she still had some accounts to settle and that
      other child upstairs to fetch. Mathieu, who had intended to keep the cab
      and drive to the Northern terminus, then experienced a feeling of
      curiosity, and thought of witnessing the departure of the nurse-agents. So
      he calmed La Couteau by telling her that if she would make haste he would
      wait for her. And as she asked for a quarter of an hour, it occurred to
      him to speak to Norine again, and so he also went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered Norine&rsquo;s room he found her sitting up in bed, eating one
      of the oranges which her little sisters had brought her. She had all the
      greedy instincts of a plump, pretty girl; she carefully detached each
      section of the orange, and, her eyes half closed the while, her flesh
      quivering under her streaming outspread hair, she sucked one after another
      with her fresh red lips, like a pet cat lapping a cup of milk. Mathieu&rsquo;s
      sudden entry made her start, however, and when she recognized him she
      smiled faintly in an embarrassed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he simply said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not immediately reply, but wiped her fingers on her handkerchief.
      However, it was necessary that she should say something, and so she began:
      &ldquo;You did not tell me you would come back&mdash;I was not expecting you.
      Well, it&rsquo;s done, and it&rsquo;s all for the best. I assure you there was no
      means of doing otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she spoke of her departure, asked the young man if he thought she
      might regain admittance to the works, and declared that in any case she
      should go there to see if the master would have the audacity to turn her
      away. Thus she continued while the minutes went slowly by. The
      conversation had dropped, Mathieu scarcely replying to her, when La
      Couteau, carrying the other child in her arms, at last darted in like a
      gust of wind. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make haste, let&rsquo;s make haste!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They never
      end with their figures; they try all they can to leave me without a copper
      for myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Norine detained her, asking: &ldquo;Oh! is that Rosine&rsquo;s baby? Pray do show
      it me.&rdquo; Then she uncovered the infant&rsquo;s face, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! how
      plump and pretty he is!&rdquo; And she began another sentence: &ldquo;What a pity! Can
      one have the heart&mdash;&rdquo; But then she remembered, paused, and changed
      her words: &ldquo;Yes, how heartrending it is when one has to forsake such
      little angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by! Take care of yourself!&rdquo; cried La Couteau; &ldquo;you will make me miss
      my train. And I&rsquo;ve got the return tickets, too; the five others are
      waiting for me at the station! Ah! what a fuss they would make if I got
      there too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, followed by Mathieu, she hurried away, bounding down the stairs,
      where she almost fell with her little burden. But soon she threw herself
      back in the cab, which rolled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a good job! And what do you say of that young person,
      monsieur? She wouldn&rsquo;t lay out fifteen francs a month on her own account,
      and yet she reproaches that good Mademoiselle Rosine, who has just given
      me four hundred francs to have her little one taken care of till his first
      communion. Just look at him&mdash;a superb child, isn&rsquo;t he? What a pity it
      is that the finest are often those who die the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu looked at the infant on the woman&rsquo;s knees. His garments were very
      white, of fine texture, trimmed with lace, as if he were some little
      condemned prince being taken in all luxury to execution. And the young man
      remembered that Norine had told him that the child was the offspring of
      crime. Born amid secrecy, he was now, for a fixed sum, to be handed over
      to a woman who would quietly suppress him by simply leaving some door or
      window wide open. Young though the boy was, he already had a finely-formed
      face, that suggested the beauty of a cherub. And he was very well behaved;
      he did not raise the faintest wail. But a shudder swept through Mathieu.
      How abominable!
    </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau quickly sprang from the cab as soon as they reached the
      courtyard of the St. Lazare Station. &ldquo;Thank you, monsieur, you have been
      very kind,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And if you will kindly recommend me to any ladies
      you may know, I shall be quite at their disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu, having alighted on the pavement in his turn, saw a scene
      which detained him there a few moments longer. Amid all the scramble of
      passengers and luggage, five women of peasant aspect, each carrying an
      infant, were darting in a scared, uneasy way hither and thither, like
      crows in trouble, with big yellow beaks quivering and black wings flapping
      with anxiety. Then, on perceiving La Couteau, there was one general caw,
      and all five swooped down upon her with angry, voracious mien. And, after
      a furious exchange of cries and explanations, the six banded themselves
      together, and, with cap-strings waving and skirts flying, rushed towards
      the train, carrying the little ones, like birds of prey who feared delay
      in returning to the charnel-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mathieu remained alone in the great crowd. Thus every year did these
      crows of ill omen carry off from Paris no fewer than 20,000 children, who
      were never, never seen again! Ah! that great question of the depopulation
      of France! Not merely were there those who were resolved to have no
      children, not only were infanticide and crime of other kinds rife upon all
      sides, but one-half of the babes saved from those dangers were killed.
      Thieves and murderesses, eager for lucre, flocked to the great city from
      the four points of the compass, and bore away all the budding Life that
      their arms could carry in order that they might turn it to Death! They
      beat down the game, they watched in the doorways, they sniffed from afar
      the innocent flesh on which they preyed. And the babes were carted to the
      railway stations; the cradles, the wards of hospitals and refuges, the
      wretched garrets of poor mothers, without fires and without bread&mdash;all,
      all were emptied! And the packages were heaped up, moved carelessly hither
      and thither, sent off, distributed to be murdered either by foul deed or
      by neglect. The raids swept on like tempest blasts; Death&rsquo;s scythe never
      knew dead season, at every hour it mowed down budding life. Children who
      might well have lived were taken from their mothers, the only nurses whose
      milk would have nourished them, to be carted away and to die for lack of
      proper nutriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush of blood warmed Mathieu&rsquo;s heart when, all at once, he thought of
      Marianne, so strong and healthy, who would be waiting for him on the
      bridge over the Yeuse, in the open country, with their little Gervais at
      her breast. Figures that he had seen in print came back to his mind. In
      certain regions which devoted themselves to baby-farming the mortality
      among the nurslings was fifty per cent; in the best of them it was forty,
      and seventy in the worst. It was calculated that in one century seventeen
      millions of nurslings had died. Over a long period the mortality had
      remained at from one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand per annum.
      The most deadly reigns, the greatest butcheries of the most terrible
      conquerors, had never resulted in such massacre. It was a giant battle
      that France lost every year, the abyss into which her whole strength sank,
      the charnel-place into which every hope was cast. At the end of it is the
      imbecile death of the nation. And Mathieu, seized with terror at the
      thought, rushed away, eager to seek consolation by the side of Marianne,
      amid the peacefulness, the wisdom, and the health which were their happy
      lot.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE Thursday morning Mathieu went to lunch with Dr. Boutan in the rooms
      where the latter had resided for more than ten years, in the Rue de
      l&rsquo;Universite, behind the Palais-Bourbon. By a contradiction, at which he
      himself often laughed, this impassioned apostle of fruitfulness had
      remained a bachelor. His extensive practice kept him in a perpetual hurry,
      and he had little time free beyond his dejeuner hour. Accordingly,
      whenever a friend wished to have any serious conversation with him, he
      preferred to invite him to his modest table, to partake more or less
      hastily of an egg, a cutlet, and a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu wished to ask the doctor&rsquo;s advice on a grave subject. After a
      couple of weeks&rsquo; reflection, his idea of experimenting in agriculture, of
      extricating that unappreciated estate of Chantebled from chaos,
      preoccupied him to such a degree that he positively suffered at not daring
      to come to a decision. The imperious desire to create, to produce life,
      health, strength, and wealth grew within him day by day. Yet what fine
      courage and what a fund of hope he needed to venture upon an enterprise
      which outwardly seemed so wild and rash, and the wisdom of which was
      apparent to himself alone. With whom could he discuss such a matter, to
      whom could he confide his doubts and hesitation? When the idea of
      consulting Boutan occurred to him, he at once asked the doctor for an
      appointment. Here was such a confidant as he desired, a man of broad,
      brave mind, one who worshipped life, who was endowed with far-seeing
      intelligence, and who would therefore at once look beyond the first
      difficulties of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were face to face on either side of the table, Mathieu
      began to pour forth his confession, recounting his dream&mdash;his poem,
      as he called it. And the doctor listened without interrupting, evidently
      won over by the young man&rsquo;s growing, creative emotion. When at last Boutan
      had to express an opinion he replied: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, my friend, I can
      tell you nothing from a practical point of view, for I have never even
      planted a lettuce. I will even add that your project seems to me so
      hazardous that any one versed in these matters whom you might consult
      would assuredly bring forward substantial and convincing arguments to
      dissuade you. But you speak of this affair with such superb confidence and
      ardor and affection, that I feel convinced you would succeed. Moreover,
      you flatter my own views, for I have long endeavored to show that, if
      numerous families are ever to flourish again in France, people must again
      love and worship the soil, and desert the towns, and lead a fruitful
      fortifying country life. So how can I disapprove your plans? Moreover, I
      suspect that, like all people who ask advice, you simply came here in the
      hope that you would find in me a brother ready, in principle at all
      events, to wage the same battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this they both laughed heartily. Then, on Boutan inquiring with what
      capital he would start operations, Mathieu quietly explained that he did
      not mean to borrow money and thus run into debt; he would begin, if
      necessary, with very few acres indeed, convinced as he was of the
      conquering power of labor. His would be the head, and he would assuredly
      find the necessary arms. His only worry was whether he would be able to
      induce Seguin to sell him the old hunting-box and the few acres round it
      on a system of yearly payments, without preliminary disbursement. When he
      spoke to the doctor on this subject, the other replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I think he is very favorably disposed. I know that he would be
      delighted to sell that huge, unprofitable estate, for with his increasing
      pecuniary wants he is very much embarrassed by it. You are aware, no
      doubt, that things are going from bad to worse in his household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the doctor broke off to inquire: &ldquo;And our friend Beauchene, have you
      warned him of your intention to leave the works?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not yet,&rdquo; said Mathieu; &ldquo;and I would ask you to keep the matter
      private, for I wish to have everything settled before informing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lunching quickly, they had now got to their coffee, and the doctor offered
      to drive Mathieu back to the works, as he was going there himself, for
      Madame Beauchene had requested him to call once a week, in order that he
      might keep an eye on Maurice&rsquo;s health. Not only did the lad still suffer
      from his legs, but he had so weak and delicate a stomach that he had to be
      dieted severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the kind of stomach one finds among children who have not been
      brought up by their own mothers,&rdquo; continued Boutan. &ldquo;Your plucky wife
      doesn&rsquo;t know that trouble; she can let her children eat whatever they
      fancy. But with that poor little Maurice, the merest trifle, such as four
      cherries instead of three, provokes indigestion. Well, so it is settled, I
      will drive you back to the works. Only I must first make a call in the Rue
      Roquepine to choose a nurse. It won&rsquo;t take me long, I hope. Quick! let us
      be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were together in the brougham, Boutan told Mathieu that it was
      precisely for the Seguins that he was going to the nurse-agency. There was
      a terrible time at the house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin. A few months
      previously Valentine had given birth to a daughter, and her husband had
      obstinately resolved to select a fit nurse for the child himself,
      pretending that he knew all about such matters. And he had chosen a big,
      sturdy young woman of monumental appearance. Nevertheless, for two months
      past Andree, the baby, had been pining away, and the doctor had
      discovered, by analyzing the nurse&rsquo;s milk, that it was deficient in
      nutriment. Thus the child was simply perishing of starvation. To change a
      nurse is a terrible thing, and the Seguins&rsquo; house was in a tempestuous
      state. The husband rushed hither and thither, banging the doors and
      declaring that he would never more occupy himself about anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; added Boutan, &ldquo;I have now been instructed to choose a fresh
      nurse. And it is a pressing matter, for I am really feeling anxious about
      that poor little Andree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did not the mother nurse her child?&rdquo; asked Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made a gesture of despair. &ldquo;Ah! my dear fellow, you ask me too
      much. But how would you have a Parisienne of the wealthy bourgeoisie
      undertake the duty, the long brave task of nursing a child, when she leads
      the life she does, what with receptions and dinners and soirees, and
      absences and social obligations of all sorts? That little Madame Seguin is
      simply trifling when she puts on an air of deep distress and says that she
      would so much have liked to nurse her infant, but that it was impossible
      since she had no milk. She never even tried! When her first child was born
      she could doubtless have nursed it. But to-day, with the imbecile, spoilt
      life she leads, it is quite certain that she is incapable of making such
      an effort. The worst is, my dear fellow, as any doctor will tell you, that
      after three or four generations of mothers who do not feed their children
      there comes a generation that cannot do so. And so, my friend, we are fast
      coming, not only in France, but in other countries where the odious
      wet-nurse system is in vogue, to a race of wretched, degenerate women, who
      will be absolutely powerless to nourish their offspring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu then remembered what he had witnessed at Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s and the
      Foundling Hospital. And he imparted his impressions to Boutan, who again
      made a despairing gesture. There was a great work of social salvation to
      be accomplished, said he. No doubt a number of philanthropists were trying
      their best to improve things, but private effort could not cope with such
      widespread need. There must be general measures; laws must be passed to
      save the nation. The mother must be protected and helped, even in secrecy,
      if she asked for it; she must be cared for, succored, from the earliest
      period, and right through all the long months during which she fed her
      babe. All sorts of establishments would have to be founded&mdash;refuges,
      convalescent homes, and so forth; and there must be protective enactments,
      and large sums of money voted to enable help to be extended to all
      mothers, whatever they might be. It was only by such preventive steps that
      one could put a stop to the frightful hecatomb of newly-born infants, that
      incessant loss of life which exhausted the nation and brought it nearer
      and nearer to death every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;it may all be summed up in this verity: &lsquo;It
      is a mother&rsquo;s duty to nurse her child.&rsquo; And, besides, a mother, is she not
      the symbol of all grandeur, all strength, all beauty? She represents the
      eternity of life. She deserves a social culture, she should be religiously
      venerated. When we know how to worship motherhood, our country will be
      saved. And this is why, my friend, I should like a mother feeding her babe
      to be adopted as the highest expression of human beauty. Ah! how can one
      persuade our Parisiennes, all our French women, indeed, that woman&rsquo;s
      beauty lies in being a mother with an infant on her knees? Whenever that
      fashion prevails, we shall be the sovereign nation, the masters of the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended by laughing in a distressed way, in his despair at being unable
      to change manners and customs, aware as he was that the nation could be
      revolutionized only by a change in its ideal of true beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sum up, then, I believe in a child being nursed only by its own
      mother. Every mother who neglects that duty when she can perform it is a
      criminal. Of course, there are instances when she is physically incapable
      of accomplishing her duty, and in that case there is the feeding-bottle,
      which, if employed with care and extreme cleanliness, only sterilized milk
      being used, will yield a sufficiently good result. But to send a child
      away to be nursed means almost certain death; and as for the nurse in the
      house, that is a shameful transaction, a source of incalculable evil, for
      both the employer&rsquo;s child and the nurse&rsquo;s child frequently die from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the doctor&rsquo;s brougham drew up outside the nurse-agency in the
      Rue Roquepine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you have never been in such a place, although you are the
      father of five children,&rdquo; said Boutan to Mathieu, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, come with me. One ought to know everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office in the Rue Roquepine was the most important and the one with
      the best reputation in the district. It was kept by Madame Broquette, a
      woman of forty, with a dignified if somewhat blotched face, who was always
      very tightly laced in a faded silk gown of dead-leaf hue. But if she
      represented the dignity and fair fame of the establishment in its
      intercourse with clients, the soul of the place, the ever-busy
      manipulator, was her husband, Monsieur Broquette, a little man with a
      pointed nose, quick eyes, and the agility of a ferret. Charged with the
      police duties of the office, the supervision and training of the nurses,
      he received them, made them clean themselves, taught them to smile and put
      on pleasant ways, besides penning them in their various rooms and
      preventing them from eating too much. From morn till night he was ever
      prowling about, scolding and terrorizing those dirty, ill-behaved, and
      often lying and thieving women. The building, a dilapidated private house,
      with a damp ground floor, to which alone clients were admitted, had two
      upper stories, each comprising six rooms arranged as dormitories, in which
      the nurses and their infants slept. There was no end to the arrivals and
      departures there: the peasant women were ever galloping through the place,
      dragging trunks about, carrying babes in swaddling clothes, and filling
      the rooms and the passages with wild cries and vile odors. And amid all
      this the house had another inmate, Mademoiselle Broquette, Herminie as she
      was called, a long, pale, bloodless girl of fifteen, who mooned about
      languidly among that swarm of sturdy young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boutan, who knew the house well, went in, followed by Mathieu. The central
      passage, which was fairly broad, ended in a glass door, which admitted one
      to a kind of courtyard, where a sickly conifer stood on a round patch of
      grass, which the dampness rotted. On the right of the passage was the
      office, whither Madame Broquette, at the request of her customers,
      summoned the nurses, who waited in a neighboring room, which was simply
      furnished with a greasy deal table in the centre. The furniture of the
      office was some old Empire stuff, upholstered in red velvet. There was a
      little mahogany centre table, and a gilt clock. Then, on the left of the
      passage, near the kitchen, was the general refectory, with two long
      tables, covered with oilcloth, and surrounded by straggling chairs, whose
      straw seats were badly damaged. Just a make-believe sweep with a broom was
      given there every day: one could divine long-amassed, tenacious dirt in
      every dim corner; and the place reeked with an odor of bad cookery mingled
      with that of sour milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Boutan thrust open the office door he saw that Madame Broquette was
      busy with an old gentleman, who sat there inspecting a party of nurses.
      She recognized the doctor, and made a gesture of regret. &ldquo;No matter, no
      matter,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I am not in a hurry: I will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the open door Mathieu had caught sight of Mademoiselle Herminie,
      the daughter of the house, ensconced in one of the red velvet armchairs
      near the window, and dreamily perusing a novel there, while her mother,
      standing up, extolled her goods in her most dignified way to the old
      gentleman, who gravely contemplated the procession of nurses and seemed
      unable to make up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have a look at the garden,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the boasts of the establishment, indeed, as set forth in its
      prospectus, was a garden and a tree in it, as if there were plenty of good
      air there, as in the country. They opened the glass door, and on a bench
      near the tree they saw a plump girl, who doubtless had just arrived,
      pretending to clean a squealing infant. She herself looked sordid, and had
      evidently not washed since her journey. In one corner there was an
      overflow of kitchen utensils, a pile of cracked pots and greasy and rusty
      saucepans. Then, at the other end, a French window gave access to the
      nurses&rsquo; waiting-room, and here again there was a nauseous spectacle of
      dirt and untidiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Monsieur Broquette darted forward, though whence he had come
      it was hard to say. At all events, he had seen Boutan, who was a client
      that needed attention. &ldquo;Is my wife busy, then?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I cannot allow
      you to remain waiting here, doctor. Come, come, I pray you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his little ferreting eyes he had caught sight of the dirty girl
      cleaning the child, and he was anxious that his visitors should see
      nothing further of a character to give them a bad impression of the
      establishment. &ldquo;Pray, doctor, follow me,&rdquo; he repeated, and understanding
      that an example was necessary, he turned to the girl, exclaiming, &ldquo;What
      business have you to be here? Why haven&rsquo;t you gone upstairs to wash and
      dress? I shall fling a pailful of water in your face if you don&rsquo;t hurry
      off and tidy yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he forced her to rise and drove her off, all scared and terrified, in
      front of him. When she had gone upstairs he led the two gentlemen to the
      office entrance and began to complain: &ldquo;Ah! doctor, if you only knew what
      trouble I have even to get those girls to wash their hands! We who are so
      clean! who put all our pride in keeping the house clean. If ever a speck
      of dust is seen anywhere it is certainly not my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the girl had gone upstairs a fearful tumult had arisen on the upper
      floors, whence also a vile smell descended. Some dispute, some battle,
      seemed to be in progress. There were shouts and howls, followed by a
      furious exchange of vituperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; at last exclaimed Monsieur Broquette; &ldquo;my wife will
      receive you in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he slipped off and flew up the stairs with noiseless agility.
      And directly afterwards there was an explosion. Then the house suddenly
      sank into death-like silence. All that could be heard was the voice of
      Madame in the office, as, in a very dignified manner, she kept on praising
      her goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; said Boutan to Mathieu, while they walked up and down
      the passage, &ldquo;all this, the material side of things, is nothing. What you
      should see and know is what goes on in the minds of all these people. And
      note that this is a fair average place. There are others which are real
      dens, and which the police sometimes have to close. No doubt there is a
      certain amount of supervision, and there are severe regulations which
      compel the nurses to bring certificates of morality, books setting forth
      their names, ages, parentage, the situations they have held, and so on,
      with other documents on which they have immediately to secure a signature
      from the Prefecture, where the final authorization is granted them. But
      these precautions don&rsquo;t prevent fraud and deceit of various kinds. The
      women assert that they have only recently begun nursing, when they have
      been doing it for months; they show you superb children which they have
      borrowed and which they assert to be their own. And there are many other
      tricks to which they resort in their eagerness to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the doctor and Mathieu chatted on, they paused for a moment near the
      door of the refectory, which chanced to be open, and there, among other
      young peasant women, they espied La Couteau hastily partaking of cold
      meat. Doubtless she had just arrived from Rougemont, and, after disposing
      of the batch of nurses she had brought with her, was seeking sustenance
      for the various visits which she would have to make before returning home.
      The refectory, with its wine-stained tables and greasy walls, cast a smell
      like that of a badly-kept sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so you know La Couteau!&rdquo; exclaimed Boutan, when Mathieu had told him
      of his meetings with the woman. &ldquo;Then you know the depths of crime. La
      Couteau is an ogress! And yet, think of it, with our fine social
      organization, she is more or less useful, and perhaps I myself shall be
      happy to choose one of the nurses that she has brought with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Madame Broquette very amiably asked the visitors into her
      office. After long reflection, the old gentleman had gone off without
      selecting any nurse, but saying that he would return some other time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are folks who don&rsquo;t know their own minds,&rdquo; said Madame Broquette
      sententiously. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my fault, and I sincerely beg you to excuse me,
      doctor. If you want a good nurse you will be satisfied, for I have just
      received some excellent ones from the provinces. I will show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herminie, meanwhile, had not condescended to raise her nose from her
      novel. She remained ensconced in her armchair, still reading, with a
      weary, bored expression on her anaemic countenance. Mathieu, after sitting
      down a little on one side, contented himself with looking on, while Boutan
      stood erect, attentive to every detail, like a commander reviewing his
      troops. And the procession began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having opened a door which communicated with the common room, Madame
      Broquette, assuming the most noble airs, leisurely introduced the pick of
      her nurses, in groups of three, each with her infant in her arms. About a
      dozen were thus inspected: short ones with big heavy limbs, tall ones
      suggesting maypoles, dark ones with coarse stiff hair, fair ones with the
      whitest of skins, quick ones and slow ones, ugly ones and others who were
      pleasant-looking. All, however, wore the same nervous, silly smile, all
      swayed themselves with embarrassed timidity, the anxious mien of the
      bondswoman at the slave market, who fears that she may not find a
      purchaser. They clumsily tried to put on graceful ways, radiant with
      internal joy directly a customer seemed to nibble, but clouding over and
      casting black glances at their companions when the latter seemed to have
      the better chance. Out of the dozen the doctor began by setting three
      aside, and finally he detained but one, in order that he might study her
      more fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see that Monsieur le Docteur knows his business,&rdquo; Madame
      Broquette allowed herself to say, with a flattering smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often
      have such pearls. But she has only just arrived, otherwise she would
      probably have been engaged already. I can answer for her as I could for
      myself, for I have put her out before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was a dark woman of about twenty-six, of average height, built
      strongly enough, but having a heavy, common face with a hard-looking jaw.
      Having already been in service, however, she held herself fairly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that child is not your first one?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, he&rsquo;s my third.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Boutan inquired into her circumstances, studied her papers, took her
      into Madame Broquette&rsquo;s private room for examination, and on his return
      make a minute inspection of her child, a strong plump boy, some three
      months old, who in the interval had remained very quiet on an armchair.
      The doctor seemed satisfied, but he suddenly raised his head to ask, &ldquo;And
      that child is really your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur, where could I have got him otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my girl, children are borrowed, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he paused for a moment, still hesitating and looking at the young
      woman, embarrassed by some feeling of doubt, although she seemed to embody
      all requirements. &ldquo;And are you all quite well in your family?&rdquo; he asked;
      &ldquo;have none of your relatives ever died of chest complaints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course you would not tell me if they had. Your books ought to
      contain a page for information of that kind. And you, are you of sober
      habits? You don&rsquo;t drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the young woman bristled up, and Boutan had to calm her. Then
      her face brightened with pleasure as soon as the doctor&mdash;with the
      gesture of a man who is taking his chance, for however careful one may be
      there is always an element of chance in such matters&mdash;said to her:
      &ldquo;Well, it is understood, I engage you. If you can send your child away at
      once, you can go this evening to the address I will give you. Let me see,
      what is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie Lebleu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Broquette, who, without presuming to interfere with a doctor, had
      retained her majestic air which so fully proclaimed the high
      respectability of her establishment, now turned towards her daughter:
      &ldquo;Herminie, go to see if Madame Couteau is still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the girl slowly raised her pale dreamy eyes without stirring from
      her chair, her mother came to the conclusion that she had better execute
      the commission herself. A moment later she came back with La Couteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was now settling money matters. Eighty francs a month for the
      nurse; and forty-five francs for her board and lodging at the agency and
      Madame Broquette&rsquo;s charges. Then there was the question of her child&rsquo;s
      return to the country, which meant another thirty francs, without counting
      a gratuity to La Couteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back this evening,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite willing to take
      the little one with me. In the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, did you say? Oh! I know,
      there&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s maid from my district in that house. Marie can go there
      at once. When I&rsquo;ve settled my business, in a couple of hours, I will go
      and rid her of her baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On entering the office, La Couteau had glanced askance at Mathieu,
      without, however, appearing to recognize him. He had remained on his chair
      silently watching the scene&mdash;first an inspection as of cattle at a
      market, and then a bargaining, the sale of a mother&rsquo;s milk. And by degrees
      pity and revolt had filled his heart. But a shudder passed through him
      when La Couteau turned towards the quiet, fine-looking child, of which she
      promised to rid the nurse. And once more he pictured her with her five
      companions at the St.-Lazare railway station, each, like some voracious
      crow, with a new-born babe in her clutches. It was the pillaging beginning
      afresh; life and hope were again being stolen from Paris. And this time,
      as the doctor said, a double murder was threatened; for, however careful
      one may be, the employer&rsquo;s child often dies from another&rsquo;s milk, and the
      nurse&rsquo;s child, carried back into the country like a parcel, is killed with
      neglect and indigestible pap.
    </p>
    <p>
      But everything was now settled, and so the doctor and his companion drove
      away to Grenelle. And there, at the very entrance of the Beauchene works,
      came a meeting which again filled Mathieu with emotion. Morange, the
      accountant, was returning to his work after dejeuner, accompanied by his
      daughter Reine, both of them dressed in deep mourning. On the morrow of
      Valerie&rsquo;s funeral, Morange had returned to his work in a state of
      prostration which almost resembled forgetfulness. It was clear that he had
      abandoned all ambitious plans of quitting the works to seek a big fortune
      elsewhere. Still he could not make up his mind to leave his flat, though
      it was now too large for him, besides being too expensive. But then his
      wife had lived in those rooms, and he wished to remain in them. And,
      moreover, he desired to provide his daughter with all comfort. All the
      affection of his weak heart was now given to that child, whose resemblance
      to her mother distracted him. He would gaze at her for hours with tears in
      his eyes. A great passion was springing up within him; his one dream now
      was to dower her richly and seek happiness through her, if indeed he could
      ever be happy again. Thus feelings of avarice had come to him; he
      economized with respect to everything that was not connected with her, and
      secretly sought supplementary work in order that he might give her more
      luxury and increase her dower. Without her he would have died of weariness
      and self-abandonment. She was indeed fast becoming his very life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said she with a pretty smile, in answer to a question which
      Boutan put to her, &ldquo;it is I who have brought poor papa back. I wanted to
      be sure that he would take a stroll before setting to work again. Other
      wise he shuts himself up in his room and doesn&rsquo;t stir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange made a vague apologetic gesture. At home, indeed, overcome as he
      was by grief and remorse, he lived in his bedroom in the company of a
      collection of his wife&rsquo;s portraits, some fifteen photographs, showing her
      at all ages, which he had hung on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very fine to-day, Monsieur Morange,&rdquo; said Boutan, &ldquo;you do right in
      taking a stroll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man raised his eyes in astonishment, and glanced at the sun as
      if he had not previously noticed it. &ldquo;That is true, it is fine weather&mdash;and
      besides it is very good for Reine to go out a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he tenderly gazed at her, so charming, so pink and white in her black
      mourning gown. He was always fearing that she must feel bored during the
      long hours when he left her at home, alone with the servant. To him
      solitude was so distressful, so full of the wife whom he mourned, and whom
      he accused himself of having killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa won&rsquo;t believe that one never feels <i>ennui</i> at my age,&rdquo; said the
      girl gayly. &ldquo;Since my poor mamma is no longer there, I must needs be a
      little woman. And, besides, the Baroness sometimes calls to take me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave a shrill cry on seeing a brougham draw up close to the curb.
      A woman was leaning out of the window, and she recognized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, papa, there is the Baroness! She must have gone to our house, and
      Clara must have told her that I had accompanied you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, was what had happened. Morange hastily led Reine to the
      carriage, from which Seraphine did not alight. And when his daughter had
      sprung in joyously, he remained there another moment, effusively thanking
      the Baroness, and delighted to think that his dear child was going to
      amuse herself. Then, after watching the brougham till it disappeared, he
      entered the factory, looking suddenly aged and shrunken, as if his grief
      had fallen on his shoulders once more, so overwhelming him that he quite
      forgot the others, and did not even take leave of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; muttered Mathieu, who had turned icy cold on seeing
      Seraphine&rsquo;s bright mocking face and red hair at the carriage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was going to his office when Beauchene beckoned to him from one of
      the windows of the house to come in with the doctor. The pair of them
      found Constance and Maurice in the little drawing-room, whither the father
      had repaired to finish his coffee and smoke a cigar. Boutan immediately
      attended to the child, who was much better with respect to his legs, but
      who still suffered from stomachic disturbance, the slightest departure
      from the prescribed diet leading to troublesome complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, though she did not confess it, had become really anxious about
      the boy, and questioned the doctor, and listened to him with all
      eagerness. While she was thus engaged Beauchene drew Mathieu on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began, laughing, &ldquo;why did you not tell me that everything was
      finished over yonder? I met the pretty blonde in the street yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu quietly replied that he had waited to be questioned in order to
      render an account of his mission, for he had not cared to be the first to
      raise such a painful subject. The money handed to him for expenses had
      proved sufficient, and whenever the other desired it, he could produce
      receipts for his various disbursements. He was already entering into
      particulars when Beauchene jovially interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what happened here? She had the audacity to come and ask for
      work, not of me of course, but of the foreman of the women&rsquo;s work-room.
      Fortunately I had foreseen this and had given strict orders; so the
      foreman told her that considerations of order and discipline prevented him
      from taking her back. Her sister Euphrasie, who is to be married next
      week, is still working here. Just fancy them having another set-to!
      Besides, her place is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to take a little glass of cognac which stood on the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had learnt only the day before that Norine, on leaving Madame
      Bourdieu&rsquo;s, had sought a temporary refuge with a female friend, not caring
      to resume a life of quarrelling at her parents&rsquo; home. Besides her attempt
      to regain admittance at Beauchene&rsquo;s, she had applied at two other
      establishments; but, as a matter of fact, she did not evince any
      particular ardor in seeking to obtain work. Four months&rsquo; idleness and
      coddling had altogether disgusted her with a factory hand&rsquo;s life, and the
      inevitable was bound to happen. Indeed Beauchene, as he came back sipping
      his cognac, resumed: &ldquo;Yes, I met her in the street. She was quite smartly
      dressed, and leaning on the arm of a big, bearded young fellow, who did
      nothing but make eyes at her. It was certain to come to that, you know. I
      always thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he was stepping towards his wife and the doctor, when he remembered
      something else, came back, and asked Mathieu in a yet lower tone, &ldquo;What
      was it you were telling me about the child?&rdquo; And as soon as Mathieu had
      related that he had taken the infant to the Foundling Hospital so as to be
      certain that it was deposited there, he warmly pressed his hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      perfect. Thank you, my dear fellow; I shall be at peace now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt, indeed, intensely relieved, hummed a lively air, and then took
      his stand before Constance, who was still consulting the doctor. She was
      holding little Maurice against her knees, and gazing at him with the
      jealous love of a good bourgeoise, who carefully watched over the health
      of her only son, that son whom she wished to make a prince of industry and
      wealth. All at once, however, in reply to a remark from Boutan, she
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Why then, doctor, you think me culpable? You really say that a
      child, nursed by his mother, always has a stronger constitution than
      others, and can the better resist the ailments of childhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there is no doubt of it, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene, ceasing to chew his cigar, shrugged his shoulders, and burst
      into a sonorous laugh: &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you worry, that youngster will live to
      be a hundred! Why, the Burgundian who nursed him was as strong as a rock!
      But, I say, doctor, you intend then to make the Chambers pass a law for
      obligatory nursing by mothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this sally Boutan also began to laugh. &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This at once supplied Beauchene with material for innumerable jests. Why,
      such a law would completely upset manners and customs, social life would
      be suspended, and drawing-rooms would become deserted! Posters would be
      placarded everywhere bearing the inscription: &ldquo;Closed on account of
      nursing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefly,&rdquo; said Beauchene, in conclusion, &ldquo;you want to have a revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A revolution, yes,&rdquo; the doctor gently replied, &ldquo;and we will effect it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      MATHIEU finished studying his great scheme, the clearing and cultivation
      of Chantebled, and at last, contrary to all prudence but with all the
      audacity of fervent faith and hope, it was resolved upon. He warned
      Beauchene one morning that he should leave the works at the end of the
      month, for on the previous day he had spoken to Seguin, and had found him
      quite willing to sell the little pavilion and some fifty acres around it
      on very easy terms. As Mathieu had imagined, Seguin&rsquo;s affairs were in a
      very muddled state, for he had lost large sums at the gaming table and
      spent money recklessly on women, leading indeed a most disastrous life
      since trouble had arisen in his home. And so he welcomed the transaction
      which Mathieu proposed to him, in the hope that the young man would end by
      ridding him of the whole of that unprofitable estate should his first
      experiment prove successful. Then came other interviews between them, and
      Seguin finally consented to sell on a system of annual payments, spread
      over a term of years, the first to be made in two years&rsquo; time from that
      date. As things stood, the property seemed likely to remain unremunerative
      forever, and so there was nothing risked in allowing the purchaser a
      couple of years&rsquo; credit. However, they agreed to meet once more and settle
      the final details before a formal deed of sale was drawn up. And one
      Monday morning, therefore, about ten o&rsquo;clock, Mathieu set out for the
      house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin in order to complete the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, as it happened, Celeste the maid received in the linen room,
      where she usually remained, a visit from her friend Madame Menoux, the
      little haberdasher of the neighborhood, in whose tiny shop she was so fond
      of gossiping. They had become more intimate than ever since La Couteau, at
      Celeste&rsquo;s instigation, had taken Madame Menoux&rsquo;s child, Pierre, to
      Rougemont, to be put out to nurse there in the best possible way for the
      sum of thirty francs a month. La Couteau had also very complaisantly
      promised to call each month at one or another of her journeys in order to
      receive the thirty francs, thereby saving the mother the trouble of
      sending the money by post, and also enabling her to obtain fresh news of
      her child. Thus, each time a payment became due, if La Couteau&rsquo;s journey
      happened to be delayed a single day, Madame Menoux grew terribly
      frightened, and hastened off to Celeste to make inquiries of her. And,
      moreover, she was glad to have an opportunity of conversing with this
      girl, who came from the very part where her little Pierre was being
      reared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse, me, won&rsquo;t you, mademoiselle, for calling so early,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;but you told me that your lady never required you before nine
      o&rsquo;clock. And I&rsquo;ve come, you know, because I&rsquo;ve had no news from over
      yonder, and it occurred to me that you perhaps might have received a
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blonde, short and thin, Madame Menoux, who was the daughter of a poor
      clerk, had a slender pale face, and a pleasant, but somewhat sad,
      expression. From her own slightness of build probably sprang her
      passionate admiration for her big, handsome husband, who could have
      crushed her between his fingers. If she was slight, however, she was
      endowed with unconquerable tenacity and courage, and she would have killed
      herself with hard work to provide him with the coffee and cognac which he
      liked to sip after each repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to have had to send our Pierre so far
      away. As it is, I don&rsquo;t see my husband all day, and now I&rsquo;ve a child whom
      I never see at all. But the misfortune is that one has to live, and how
      could I have kept the little fellow in that tiny shop of mine, where from
      morning till night I never have a moment to spare! Yet, I can&rsquo;t help
      crying at the thought that I wasn&rsquo;t able to keep and nurse him. When my
      husband comes home from the museum every evening, we do nothing but talk
      about him, like a pair of fools. And so, according to you, mademoiselle,
      that place Rougemont is very healthy, and there are never any nasty
      illnesses about there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment she was interrupted by the arrival of another early
      visitor, whose advent she hailed with a cry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how happy I am to see you, Madame Couteau! What a good idea it was of
      mine to call here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid exclamations of joyous surprise, the nurse-agent explained that she
      had arrived by the night train with a batch of nurses, and had started on
      her round of visits as soon as she had deposited them in the Rue
      Roquepine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After bidding Celeste good-day in passing,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I intended to call
      on you, my dear lady. But since you are here, we can settle our accounts
      here, if you are agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Menoux, however, was looking at her very anxiously. &ldquo;And how is my
      little Pierre?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not so bad, not so bad. He is not, you know, one of the strongest;
      one can&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;s a big child. Only he&rsquo;s so pretty and nice-looking
      with his rather pale face. And it&rsquo;s quite certain that if there are bigger
      babies than he is, there are smaller ones too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke more slowly as she proceeded, and carefully sought words which
      might render the mother anxious, without driving her to despair. These
      were her usual tactics in order to disturb her customers&rsquo; hearts, and then
      extract as much money from them as possible. On this occasion she must
      have guessed that she might carry things so far as to ascribe a slight
      illness to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I must really tell you, because I don&rsquo;t know how to lie; and
      besides, after all, it&rsquo;s my duty&mdash;Well, the poor little darling has
      been ill, and he&rsquo;s not quite well again yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Menoux turned very pale and clasped her puny little hands: &ldquo;<i>Mon
      Dieu</i>! he will die of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, since I tell you that he&rsquo;s already a little better. And certainly
      he doesn&rsquo;t lack good care. You should just see how La Loiseau coddles him!
      When children are well behaved they soon get themselves loved. And the
      whole house is at his service, and no expense is spared The doctor came
      twice, and there was even some medicine. And that costs money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words fell from La Couteau&rsquo;s lips with the weight of a club.
      Then, without leaving the scared, trembling mother time to recover, the
      nurse-agent continued: &ldquo;Shall we go into our accounts, my dear lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Menoux, who had intended to make a payment before returning to her
      shop, was delighted to have some money with her. They looked for a slip of
      paper on which to set down the figures; first the month&rsquo;s nursing, thirty
      francs; then the doctor, six francs; and indeed, with the medicine, that
      would make ten francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! and besides, I meant to tell you,&rdquo; added La Couteau, &ldquo;that so much
      linen was dirtied during his illness that you really ought to add three
      francs for the soap. That would only be just; and besides, there were
      other little expenses, sugar, and eggs, so that in your place, to act like
      a good mother, I should put down five francs. Forty-five francs
      altogether, will that suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her emotion Madame Menoux felt that she was being robbed, that
      the other was speculating on her distress. She made a gesture of surprise
      and revolt at the idea of having to give so much money&mdash;that money
      which she found so hard to earn. No end of cotton and needles had to be
      sold to get such a sum together! And her distress, between the necessity
      of economy on the one hand and her maternal anxiety on the other, would
      have touched the hardest heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that will make another half-month&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this La Couteau put on her most frigid air: &ldquo;Well, what would you have?
      It isn&rsquo;t my fault. One can&rsquo;t let your child die, so one must incur the
      necessary expenses. And then, if you haven&rsquo;t confidence in me, say so;
      send the money and settle things direct. Indeed, that will greatly relieve
      me, for in all this I lose my time and trouble; but then, I&rsquo;m always
      stupid enough to be too obliging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Menoux, again quivering and anxious, had given way, another
      difficulty arose. She had only some gold with her, two twenty-franc pieces
      and one ten-franc piece. The three coins lay glittering on the table. La
      Couteau looked at them with her yellow fixed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t give you your five francs change,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any
      change with me. And you, Celeste, have you any change for this lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She risked asking this question, but put it in such a tone and with such a
      glance that the other immediately understood her. &ldquo;I have not a copper in
      my pocket,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep silence fell. Then, with bleeding heart and a gesture of cruel
      resignation, Madame Menoux did what was expected of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep those five francs for yourself, Madame Couteau, since you have to
      take so much trouble. And, <i>mon Dieu</i>! may all this money bring me
      good luck, and at least enable my poor little fellow to grow up a fine
      handsome man like his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for that I&rsquo;ll warrant it,&rdquo; cried the other, with enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;Those little ailments don&rsquo;t mean anything&mdash;on the contrary. I see
      plenty of little folks, I do; and so just remember what I tell you, yours
      will become an extraordinarily fine child. There won&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Menoux went off, La Couteau had lavished such flattery and
      such promises upon her that she felt quite light and gay; no longer
      regretting her money, but dreaming of the day when little Pierre would
      come back to her with plump cheeks and all the vigor of a young oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the door had closed behind the haberdasher, Celeste began to
      laugh in her impudent way: &ldquo;What a lot of fibs you told her! I don&rsquo;t
      believe that her child so much as caught a cold,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau began by assuming a dignified air: &ldquo;Say that I&rsquo;m a liar at
      once. The child isn&rsquo;t well, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid&rsquo;s gayety only increased at this. &ldquo;Well now, you are really
      comical, putting on such airs with me. I know you, remember, and I know
      what is meant when the tip of your nose begins to wriggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child is quite puny,&rdquo; repeated her friend, more gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can believe that. All the same I should like to see the doctor&rsquo;s
      prescriptions, and the soap and the sugar. But, you know, I don&rsquo;t care a
      button about the matter. As for that little Madame Menoux, it&rsquo;s here
      to-day and gone to-morrow. She has her business, and I have mine. And you,
      too, have yours, and so much the better if you get as much out of it as
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But La Couteau changed the conversation by asking the maid if she could
      not give her a drop of something to drink, for night travelling did upset
      her stomach so. Thereupon Celeste, with a laugh, took a bottle half-full
      of malaga and a box of biscuits from the bottom of a cupboard. This was
      her little secret store, stolen from the still-room. Then, as the other
      expressed a fear that her mistress might surprise them, she made a gesture
      of insolent contempt. Her mistress! Why, she had her nose in her basins
      and perfumery pots, and wasn&rsquo;t at all likely to call till she had fixed
      herself up so as to look pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are only the children to fear,&rdquo; added Celeste; &ldquo;that Gaston and
      that Lucie, a couple of brats who are always after one because their
      parents never trouble about them, but let them come and play here or in
      the kitchen from morning till night. And I don&rsquo;t dare lock this door, for
      fear they should come rapping and kicking at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, by way of precaution, she had glanced down the passage and they had
      both seated themselves at table, they warmed and spoke out their minds,
      soon reaching a stage of easy impudence and saying everything as if quite
      unconscious how abominable it was. While sipping her wine Celeste asked
      for news of the village, and La Couteau spoke the brutal truth, between
      two biscuits. It was at the Vimeux&rsquo; house that the servant&rsquo;s last child,
      born in La Rouche&rsquo;s den, had died a fortnight after arriving at Rougemont,
      and the Vimeux, who were more or less her cousins, had sent her their
      friendly remembrances and the news that they were about to marry off their
      daughter. Then, at La Gavette&rsquo;s, the old grandfather, who looked after the
      nurslings while the family was at work in the fields, had fallen into the
      fire with a baby in his arms. Fortunately they had been pulled out of it,
      and only the little one had been roasted. La Cauchois, though at heart she
      wasn&rsquo;t downcast, now had some fears that she might be worried, because
      four little ones had gone off from her house all in a body, a window being
      forgetfully left open at night-time. They were all four little Parisians,
      it seemed&mdash;two foundlings and two that had come from Madame
      Bourdieu&rsquo;s. Since the beginning of the year as many had died at Rougemont
      as had arrived there, and the mayor had declared that far too many were
      dying, and that the village would end by getting a bad reputation. One
      thing was certain, La Couillard would be the very first to receive a visit
      from the gendarmes if she didn&rsquo;t so arrange matters as to keep at least
      one nursling alive every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? that Couillard!&rdquo; added the nurse-agent. &ldquo;Just fancy, my dear, I took
      her a child, a perfect little angel&mdash;the boy of a very pretty young
      person who was stopping at Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s. She paid four hundred francs
      to have him brought up until his first communion, and he lived just five
      days! Really now, that wasn&rsquo;t long enough! La Couillard need not have been
      so hasty. It put me in such a temper! I asked her if she wanted to
      dishonor me. What will ruin me is my good heart. I don&rsquo;t know how to
      refuse when folks ask me to do them a service. And God in Heaven knows how
      fond I am of children! I&rsquo;ve always lived among them, and in future, if
      anybody who&rsquo;s a friend of mine gives me a child to put out to nurse, I
      shall say: &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t take the little one to La Couillard, for it would be
      tempting Providence. But after all, I&rsquo;m an honest woman, and I wash my
      hands of it, for if I do take the cherubs over yonder I don&rsquo;t nurse them.
      And when one&rsquo;s conscience is at ease one can sleep quietly.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; chimed in Celeste, with an air of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they thus waxed maudlin over their malaga, there arose a horrible
      red vision&mdash;a vision of that terrible Rougemont, paved with little
      Parisians, the filthy, bloody village, the charnel-place of cowardly
      murder, whose steeple pointed so peacefully to the skies in the midst of
      the far-spreading plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all at once a rush was heard in the passage, and the servant hastened
      to the door to rid herself of Gaston and Lucie, who were approaching. &ldquo;Be
      off! I don&rsquo;t want you here. Your mamma has told you that you mustn&rsquo;t come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she came back into the room quite furious. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; said she;
      &ldquo;I can do nothing but they must come to bother me. Why don&rsquo;t they stay a
      little with the nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by the way,&rdquo; interrupted La Couteau, &ldquo;did you hear that Marie
      Lebleu&rsquo;s little one is dead? She must have had a letter about it. Such a
      fine child it was! But what can one expect? it&rsquo;s a nasty wind passing. And
      then you know the saying, &lsquo;A nurse&rsquo;s child is the child of sacrifice!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she told me she had heard of it,&rdquo; replied Celeste, &ldquo;but she begged
      me not to mention it to madame, as such things always have a bad effect.
      The worst is that if her child&rsquo;s dead madame&rsquo;s little one isn&rsquo;t much
      better off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this La Couteau pricked up her ears. &ldquo;Ah! so things are not
      satisfactory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. It isn&rsquo;t on account of her milk; that&rsquo;s good enough, and she
      has plenty of it. Only you never saw such a creature&mdash;such a temper!
      always brutal and insolent, banging the doors and talking of smashing
      everything at the slightest word. And besides, she drinks like a pig&mdash;as
      no woman ought to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau&rsquo;s pale eyes sparkled with gayety, and she briskly nodded her
      head as if to say that she knew all this and had been expecting it. In
      that part of Normandy, in and around Rougemont, all the women drank more
      or less, and the girls even carried little bottles of brandy to school
      with them in their baskets. Marie Lebleu, however, was a woman of the kind
      that one picks up under the table, and, indeed, it might be said that
      since the birth of her last child she had never been quite sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know her, my dear,&rdquo; exclaimed La Couteau; &ldquo;she is impossible. But then,
      that doctor who chose her didn&rsquo;t ask my opinion. And, besides, it isn&rsquo;t a
      matter that concerns me. I simply bring her to Paris and take her child
      back to the country. I know nothing about anything else. Let the
      gentlefolks get out of their trouble by themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sentiment tickled Celeste, who burst out laughing. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t an
      idea,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;of the infernal life that Marie leads here! She fights
      people, she threw a water-bottle at the coachman, she broke a big vase in
      madame&rsquo;s apartments, she makes them all tremble with constant dread that
      something awful may happen. And, then, if you knew what tricks she plays
      to get something to drink! For it was found out that she drank, and all
      the liqueurs were put under lock and key. So you don&rsquo;t know what she
      devised? Well, last week she drained a whole bottle of Eau de Melisse, and
      was ill, quite ill, from it. Another time she was caught sipping some Eau
      de Cologne from one of the bottles in madame&rsquo;s dressing-room. I now really
      believe that she treats herself to some of the spirits of wine that are
      given her for the warmer!&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to make one die of laughing.
      I&rsquo;m always splitting my sides over it, in my little corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she laughed till the tears came into her eyes; and La Couteau, on her
      side highly amused, began to wriggle with a savage delight. All at once,
      however, she calmed down and exclaimed, &ldquo;But, I say, they will turn her
      out of doors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that won&rsquo;t be long. They would have done so already if they had
      dared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment the ringing of a bell was heard, and an oath escaped
      Celeste. &ldquo;Good! there&rsquo;s madame ringing for me now! One can never be at
      peace for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau, however, was already standing up, quite serious, intent on
      business and ready to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, little one, don&rsquo;t be foolish, you must do your work. For my part I
      have an idea. I&rsquo;ll run to fetch one of the nurses whom I brought this
      morning, a girl I can answer for as for myself. In an hour&rsquo;s time I&rsquo;ll be
      back here with her, and there will be a little present for you if you help
      me to get her the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared while the maid, before answering a second ring, leisurely
      replaced the malaga and the biscuits at the bottom of the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock that day Seguin was to take his wife and their friend
      Santerre to Mantes, to lunch there, by way of trying an electric
      motor-car, which he had just had built at considerable expense. He had
      become fond of this new &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; less from personal taste, however, than
      from his desire to be one of the foremost in taking up a new fashion. And
      a quarter of an hour before the time fixed for starting he was already in
      his spacious &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; arrayed in what he deemed an appropriate costume:
      a jacket and breeches of greenish ribbed velvet, yellow shoes, and a
      little leather hat. And he poked fun at Santerre when the latter presented
      himself in town attire, a light gray suit of delicate effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Valentine had given birth to her daughter Andree, the novelist
      had again become a constant frequenter of the house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin.
      He was intent on resuming the little intrigue that he had begun there and
      felt confident of victory. Valentine, on her side, after a period of
      terror followed by great relief, had set about making up for lost time,
      throwing herself more wildly than ever into the vortex of fashionable
      life. She had recovered her good looks and youthfulness, and had never
      before experienced such a desire to divert herself, leaving her children
      more and more to the care of servants, and going about, hither and
      thither, as her fancy listed, particularly since her husband did the same
      in his sudden fits of jealousy and brutality, which broke out every now
      and again in the most imbecile fashion without the slightest cause. It was
      the collapse of all family life, with the threat of a great disaster in
      the future; and Santerre lived there in the midst of it, helping on the
      work of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a cry of rapture when Valentine at last made her appearance gowned
      in a delicious travelling dress, with a cavalier toque on her head. But
      she was not quite ready, for she darted off again, saying that she would
      be at their service as soon as she had seen her little Andree, and given
      her last orders to the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, make haste,&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;You are quite unbearable, you are
      never ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Mathieu called, and Seguin received him in
      order to express his regret that he could not that day go into business
      matters with him. Nevertheless, before fixing another appointment, he was
      willing to take note of certain conditions which the other wished to
      stipulate for the purpose of reserving to himself the exclusive right of
      purchasing the remainder of the Chantebled estate in portions and at fixed
      dates. Seguin was promising that he would carefully study this proposal
      when he was cut short by a sudden tumult&mdash;distant shouts, wild
      hurrying to and fro, and a violent banging of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what is it? what is it?&rdquo; he muttered, turning towards the shaking
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door suddenly opened and Valentine reappeared, distracted, red with
      fear and anger, and carrying her little Andree, who wailed and struggled
      in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, my pet,&rdquo; gasped the mother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry, she shan&rsquo;t hurt you
      any more. There, it&rsquo;s nothing, darling; be quiet, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she deposited the little girl in a large armchair, where she at once
      became quiet again. She was a very pretty child, but still so puny,
      although nearly four months old, that there seemed to be nothing but her
      beautiful big eyes in her pale little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is the matter?&rdquo; asked Seguin, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter, is, my friend, that I have just found Marie lying across the
      cradle as drunk as a market porter, and half stifling the child. If I had
      been a few moments later it would have been all over. Drunk at ten o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning! Can one understand such a thing? I had noticed that she
      drank, and so I hid the liqueurs, for I hoped to be able to keep her,
      since her milk is so good. But do you know what she had drunk? Why, the
      methylated spirits for the warmer! The empty bottle had remained beside
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did she say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She simply wanted to beat me. When I shook her, she flew at me in a
      drunken fury, shouting abominable words. And I had time only to escape
      with the little one, while she began barricading herself in the room,
      where she is now smashing the furniture! There! just listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, a distant uproar of destruction reached them. They looked one at
      the other, and deep silence fell, full of embarrassment and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Seguin ended by asking in his curt dry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can I say? That woman is a brute beast, and I can&rsquo;t leave
      Andree in her charge to be killed by her. I have brought the child here,
      and I certainly shall not take her back. I will even own that I won&rsquo;t run
      the risk of going back to the room. You will have to turn the girl out of
      doors, after paying her wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I!&rdquo; cried Seguin. Then, walking up and down as if spurring on the
      anger which was rising within him, he burst forth: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough, you
      know, of all these idiotic stories! This house has become a perfect hell
      upon earth all through that child! There will soon be nothing but fighting
      here from morning till night. First of all it was pretended that the nurse
      whom I took the trouble to choose wasn&rsquo;t healthy. Well, then a second
      nurse is engaged, and she gets drunk and stifles the child. And now, I
      suppose, we are to have a third, some other vile creature who will prey on
      us and drive us mad. No, no, it&rsquo;s too exasperating, I won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, her fears now calmed, became aggressive. &ldquo;What won&rsquo;t you have?
      There is no sense in what you say. As we have a child we must have a
      nurse. If I had spoken of nursing the little one myself you would have
      told me I was a fool. You would have found the house more uninhabitable
      than ever, if you had seen me with the child always in my arms. But I
      won&rsquo;t nurse&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. As you say, we will take a third nurse; it&rsquo;s
      simple enough, and we&rsquo;ll do so at once and risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seguin had abruptly halted in front of Andree, who, alarmed by the sight
      of his stern dark figure began to cry. Blinded as he was by anger, he
      perhaps failed to see her, even as he failed to see Gaston and Lucie, who
      had hastened in at the noise of the dispute and stood near the door, full
      of curiosity and fear. As nobody thought of sending them away they
      remained there, and saw and heard everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is waiting,&rdquo; resumed Seguin, in a voice which he strove to
      render calm. &ldquo;Let us make haste, let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine looked at him in stupefaction. &ldquo;Come, be reasonable,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;How can I leave this child when I have nobody to whom I can trust her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is waiting for us,&rdquo; he repeated, quivering; &ldquo;let us go at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as his wife this time contented herself with shrugging her shoulders,
      he was seized with one of those sudden fits of madness which impelled him
      to the greatest violence, even when people were present, and made him
      openly display his rankling poisonous sore, that absurd jealousy which had
      upset his life. As for that poor little puny, wailing child, he would have
      crushed her, for he held her to be guilty of everything, and indeed it was
      she who was now the obstacle to that excursion he had planned, that
      pleasure trip which he had promised himself, and which now seemed to him
      of such supreme importance. And &lsquo;twas so much the better if friends were
      there to hear him. So in the vilest language he began to upbraid his wife,
      not only reproaching her for the birth of that child, but even denying
      that the child was his. &ldquo;You will only be content when you have driven me
      from the house!&rdquo; he finished in a fury. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come? Well then, I&rsquo;ll
      go by myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon he rushed off like a whirlwind, without a word to Santerre,
      who had remained silent, and without even remembering that Mathieu still
      stood there awaiting an answer. The latter, in consternation at hearing
      all these things, had not dared to withdraw lest by doing so he should
      seem to be passing judgment on the scene. Standing there motionless, he
      turned his head aside, looked at little Andree who was still crying, and
      at Gaston and Lucie, who, silent with fright, pressed one against the
      other behind the armchair in which their sister was wailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine had sunk upon a chair, stifling with sobs, her limbs trembling.
      &ldquo;The wretch! Ah, how he treats me! To accuse me thus, when he knows how
      false it is! Ah! never more; no, never more! I would rather kill myself;
      yes, kill myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Santerre, who had hitherto stood on one side, gently drew near to her
      and ventured to take her hand with a gesture of affectionate compassion,
      while saying in an undertone: &ldquo;Come, calm yourself. You know very well
      that you are not alone, that you are not forsaken. There are some things
      which cannot touch you. Calm yourself, cease weeping, I beg you. You
      distress me dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made himself the more gentle since the husband had been the more
      brutal; and he leant over her yet the more closely, and again lowered his
      voice till it became but a murmur. Only a few words could be heard: &ldquo;It is
      wrong of you to worry yourself like this. Forget all that folly. I told
      you before that he doesn&rsquo;t know how to behave towards a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twice was that last remark repeated with a sort of mocking pity; and she
      smiled vaguely amid her drying tears, in her turn murmuring: &ldquo;You are
      kind, you are. Thank you. And you are quite right.... Ah! if I could only
      be a little happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu distinctly saw her press Santerre&rsquo;s hand as if in acceptance
      of his consolation. It was the logical, fatal outcome of the situation&mdash;given
      a wife whom her husband had perverted, a mother who refused to nurse her
      babe. And yet a cry from Andree suddenly set Valentine erect, awaking to
      the reality of her position. If that poor creature were so puny, dying for
      lack of her mother&rsquo;s milk, the mother also was in danger from her refusal
      to nurse her and clasp her to her breast like a buckler of invincible
      defence. Life and salvation one through the other, or disaster for both,
      such was the law. And doubtless Valentine became clearly conscious of her
      peril, for she hastened to take up the child and cover her with caresses,
      as if to make of her a protecting rampart against the supreme madness to
      which she had felt prompted. And great was the distress that came over
      her. Her other children were there, looking and listening, and Mathieu
      also was still waiting. When she perceived him her tears gushed forth
      again, and she strove to explain things, and even attempted to defend her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse him, there are moments when he quite loses his head. <i>Mon Dieu</i>!
      What will become of me with this child? Yet I can&rsquo;t nurse her now, it is
      too late. It is frightful to be in such a position without knowing what to
      do. Ah! what will become of me, good Lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Santerre again attempted to console her, but she no longer listened to
      him, and he was about to defer all further efforts till another time when
      unexpected intervention helped on his designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste, who had entered noiselessly, stood there waiting for her mistress
      to allow her to speak. &ldquo;It is my friend who has come to see me, madame,&rdquo;
       said she; &ldquo;you know, the person from my village, Sophie Couteau, and as
      she happens to have a nurse with her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a nurse here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, madame, a very fine one, an excellent one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on perceiving her mistress&rsquo;s radiant surprise, her joy at this
      relief, she showed herself zealous: &ldquo;Madame must not tire herself by
      holding the little one. Madame hasn&rsquo;t the habit. If madame will allow me,
      I will bring the nurse to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heaving a sigh of happy deliverance, Valentine had allowed the servant to
      take the child from her. So Heaven had not abandoned her! However, she
      began to discuss the matter, and was not inclined to have the nurse
      brought there. She somehow feared that if the other one, who was drunk in
      her room, should come out and meet the new arrival, she would set about
      beating them all and breaking everything. At last she insisted on taking
      Santerre and Mathieu into the linen-room, saying that the latter must
      certainly have some knowledge of these matters, although he declared the
      contrary. Only Gaston and Lucie were formally forbidden to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not wanted,&rdquo; said their mother, &ldquo;so stay here and play. But we
      others will all go, and as softly as possible, please, so that that
      drunken creature may not suspect anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in the linen-room, Valentine ordered all the doors to be carefully
      secured. La Couteau was standing there with a sturdy young person of
      five-and-twenty, who carried a superb-looking infant in her arms. She had
      dark hair, a low forehead, and a broad face, and was very respectably
      dressed. And she made a little courtesy like a well-trained nurse, who has
      already served with gentlefolks and knows how to behave. But Valentine&rsquo;s
      embarrassment remained extreme; she looked at the nurse and at the babe
      like an ignorant woman who, though her elder children had been brought up
      in a room adjoining her own, had never troubled or concerned herself about
      anything. In her despair, seeing that Santerre kept to himself, she again
      appealed to Mathieu, who once more excused himself. And it was only then
      that La Couteau, after glancing askance at the gentleman who, somehow or
      other, always turned up whenever she had business to transact, ventured to
      intervene:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will madame rely on me? If madame will kindly remember, I once before
      ventured to offer her my services, and if she had accepted them she would
      have saved herself no end of worry. That Marie Lebleu is impossible, and I
      certainly could have warned madame of it at the time when I came to fetch
      Marie&rsquo;s child. But since madame&rsquo;s doctor had chosen her, it was not for me
      to speak. Oh! she has good milk, that&rsquo;s quite sure; only she also has a
      good tongue, which is always dry. So if madame will now place confidence
      in me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she rattled on interminably, expatiating on the respectability of her
      calling, and praising the value of the goods she offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, I tell you that you can take La Catiche with your eyes
      shut. She&rsquo;s exactly what you want, there&rsquo;s no better in Paris. Just look
      how she&rsquo;s built, how sturdy and how healthy she is! And her child, just
      look at it! She&rsquo;s married, she even has a little girl of four at the
      village with her husband. She&rsquo;s a respectable woman, which is more than
      can be said for a good many nurses. In a word, madame, I know her and can
      answer for her. If you are not pleased with her I myself will give you
      your money back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her haste to get it all over Valentine made a great gesture of
      surrender. She even consented to pay one hundred francs a month, since La
      Catiche was a married woman. Moreover, La Couteau explained that she would
      not have to pay the office charges, which would mean a saving of
      forty-five francs, though, perhaps, madame would not forget all the
      trouble which she, La Couteau, had taken. On the other hand, there would,
      of course, be the expense of taking La Catiche&rsquo;s child back to the
      village, a matter of thirty francs. Valentine liberally promised to double
      that sum; and all seemed to be settled, and she felt delivered, when she
      suddenly bethought herself of the other nurse, who had barricaded herself
      in her room. How could they get her out in order to install La Catiche in
      her place?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed La Couteau, &ldquo;does Marie Lebleu frighten you? She had
      better not give me any of her nonsense if she wants me ever to find her
      another situation. I&rsquo;ll speak to her, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celeste thereupon placed Andree on a blanket, which was lying there, side
      by side with the infant of which the new nurse had rid herself a moment
      previously, and undertook to conduct La Couteau to Marie Lebleu&rsquo;s room.
      Deathlike silence now reigned there, but the nurse-agent only had to give
      her name to secure admittance. She went in, and for a few moments one only
      heard her dry curt voice. Then, on coming out, she tranquillized
      Valentine, who had gone to listen, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sobered her, I can tell you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Pay her her month&rsquo;s wages.
      She&rsquo;s packing her box and going off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as they went back into the linen-room, Valentine settled pecuniary
      matters and added five francs for this new service. But a final difficulty
      arose. La Couteau could not come back to fetch La Catiche&rsquo;s child in the
      evening, and what was she to do with it during the rest of the day? &ldquo;Well,
      no matter,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it; I&rsquo;ll deposit it at the
      office, before I go my round. They&rsquo;ll give it a bottle there, and it&rsquo;ll
      have to grow accustomed to the bottle now, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the mother quietly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as La Couteau, on the point of leaving, after all sorts of bows and
      thanks, turned round to take the little one, she made a gesture of
      hesitation on seeing the two children lying side by side on the blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t make a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed amusing, and enlivened the others. Celeste fairly exploded,
      and even La Catiche grinned broadly; while La Couteau caught up the child
      with her long claw-like hands and carried it away. Yet another gone, to be
      carted away yonder in one of those ever-recurring <i>razzias</i> which
      consigned the little babes to massacre!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu alone had not laughed. He had suddenly recalled his conversation
      with Boutan respecting the demoralizing effects of that nurse trade, the
      shameful bargaining, the common crime of two mothers, who each risked the
      death of her child&mdash;the idle mother who bought another&rsquo;s services,
      the venal mother who sold her milk. He felt cold at heart as he saw one
      child carried off still full of life, and the other remain there already
      so puny. And what would be fate&rsquo;s course? Would not one or the other,
      perhaps both of them be sacrificed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, however, was already leading both him and Santerre to the
      spacious salon again; and she was so delighted, so fully relieved, that
      she had recovered all her cavalier carelessness, her passion for noise and
      pleasure. And as Mathieu was about to take his leave, he heard the
      triumphant Santerre saying to her, while for a moment he retained her hand
      in his clasp: &ldquo;Till to-morrow, then.&rdquo; And she, who had cast her buckler of
      defence aside, made answer: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later La Catiche was the acknowledged queen of the house. Andree
      had recovered a little color, and was increasing in weight daily. And in
      presence of this result the others bowed low indeed. There was every
      disposition to overlook all possible faults on the nurse&rsquo;s part. She was
      the third, and a fourth would mean the child&rsquo;s death; so that she was an
      indispensable, a providential helper, one whose services must be retained
      at all costs. Moreover, she seemed to have no defects, for she was a calm,
      cunning, peasant woman, one who knew how to rule her employers and extract
      from them all that was to be extracted. Her conquest of the Seguins was
      effected with extraordinary skill. At first some unpleasantness seemed
      likely, because Celeste was, on her own side, pursuing a similar course;
      but they were both too intelligent to do otherwise than come to an
      understanding. As their departments were distinct, they agreed that they
      could prosecute parallel invasions. And from that moment they even helped
      one another, divided the empire, and preyed upon the house in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Catiche sat upon a throne, served by the other domestics, with her
      employers at her feet. The finest dishes were for her; she had her special
      wine, her special bread, she had everything most delicate and most
      nourishing that could be found. Gluttonous, slothful, and proud, she
      strutted about, bending one and all to her fancies. The others gave way to
      her in everything to avoid sending her into a temper which might have
      spoilt her milk. At her slightest indisposition everybody was distracted.
      One night she had an attack of indigestion, and all the doctors in the
      neighborhood were rung up to attend on her. Her only real defect, perhaps,
      was a slight inclination for pilfering; she appropriated some linen that
      was lying about, but madame would not hear of the matter being mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also the chapter of the presents which were heaped on her in
      order to keep her in good temper. Apart from the regulation present when
      the child cut its first tooth, advantage was taken of various other
      occasions, and a ring, a brooch, and a pair of earrings were given her.
      Naturally she was the most adorned nurse in the Champs-Elysees, with
      superb cloaks and the richest of caps, trimmed with long ribbons which
      flared in the sunlight. Never did lady lead a life of more sumptuous
      idleness. There were also the presents which she extracted for her husband
      and her little girl at the village. Parcels were sent them by express
      train every week. And on the morning when news came that her own baby,
      carried back by La Couteau, had died from the effects of a bad cold, she
      was presented with fifty francs as if in payment for the loss of her
      child. Little Andree, meanwhile, grew ever stronger, and thus La Catiche
      rose higher and higher, with the whole house bending low beneath her
      tyrannical sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when Mathieu called to sign the deed which was to insure him
      the possession of the little pavilion of Chantebled with some fifty acres
      around it, and the privilege of acquiring other parts of the estate on
      certain conditions, he found Seguin on the point of starting for Le Havre,
      where a friend, a wealthy Englishman, was waiting for him with his yacht,
      in order that they might have a month&rsquo;s trip round the coast of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Seguin feverishly, alluding to some recent heavy losses at the
      gaming table, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving Paris for a time&mdash;I have no luck here just
      now. But I wish you plenty of courage and all success, my dear sir. You
      know how much I am interested in the attempt you are about to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later that same day Mathieu was crossing the Champs-Elysees,
      eager to join Marianne at Chantebled, moved as he was by the decisive step
      he had taken, yet quivering also with faith and hope, when in a deserted
      avenue he espied a cab waiting, and recognized Santerre inside it. Then,
      as a veiled lady furtively sprang into the vehicle, he turned round
      wondering: Was that not Valentine? And as the cab drove off he felt
      convinced it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came other meetings when he reached the main avenue; first Gaston
      and Lucie, already tired of play, and dragging about their puny limbs
      under the careless supervision of Celeste, who was busy laughing with a
      grocer&rsquo;s man; while farther off La Catiche, superb and royal, decked out
      like the idol of venal motherhood, was giving little Andree an outing,
      with her long purple ribbons streaming victoriously in the sunshine.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the day when the first blow with the pick was dealt, Marianne, with
      Gervais in her arms, came and sat down close by, full of happy emotion at
      this work of faith and hope which Mathieu was so boldly undertaking. It
      was a clear, warm day in the middle of June, with a pure, broad sky that
      encouraged confidence. And as the children had been given a holiday, they
      played about in the surrounding grass, and one could hear the shrill cries
      of little Rose while she amused herself with running after the three boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you deal the first blow?&rdquo; Mathieu gayly asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she pointed to her baby. &ldquo;No, no, I have my work. Deal it yourself,
      you are the father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood there with two men under his orders, but ready himself to
      undertake part of the hard manual toil in order to help on the realization
      of his long thought of, ripening scheme. With great prudence and wisdom he
      had assured himself a modest livelihood for a year of effort, by an
      intelligent scheme of association and advances repayable out of profits,
      which would enable him to wait for his first harvest. And it was his life
      that he risked on that future crop, should the earth refuse his worship
      and his labor. But he was a faithful believer, one who felt certain of
      conquering, since love and determination were his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, here goes!&rdquo; he gallantly cried. &ldquo;May the earth prove a good
      mother to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he dealt the first blow with his pick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was begun to the left of the old pavilion, in a corner of that
      extensive marshy tableland, where little streams coursed on all sides
      through the reeds which sprang up everywhere. It was at first simply a
      question of draining a few acres by capturing these streams and turning
      them into canals, in order to direct them afterwards over the dry sandy
      slopes which descended towards the railway line. After an attentive
      examination Mathieu had discovered that the work might easily be executed,
      and that water-furrows would suffice, such was the disposition and nature
      of the ground. This, indeed, was his real discovery, not to mention the
      layer of humus which he felt certain would be found amassed on the
      plateau, and the wondrous fertility which it would display as soon as a
      ploughshare had passed through it. And so with his pick he now began to
      open the trench which was to drain the damp soil above, and fertilize the
      dry, sterile, thirsty ground below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open air, however, had doubtless given Gervais an appetite, for he
      began to cry. He was now a strong little fellow, three months and a half
      old, and never neglected mealtime. He was growing like one of the young
      trees in the neighboring wood, with hands which did not easily release
      what they grasped, with eyes too full of light, now all laughter and now
      all tears, and with the ever open beak of a greedy bird, that raised a
      tempest whenever his mother kept him waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know you are there,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;come, don&rsquo;t deafen us any
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave him the breast and he became quiet, simply purring like a
      happy little kitten. The beneficent source had begun to flow once more, as
      if it were inexhaustible. The trickling milk murmured unceasingly. One
      might have said that it could be heard descending and spreading, while
      Mathieu on his side continued opening his trench, assisted by the two men
      whose apprenticeship was long since past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose up at last, wiped his brow, and with his air of quiet certainty
      exclaimed: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a trade to learn. In a few months&rsquo; time I shall be
      nothing but a peasant. Look at that stagnant pond there, green with
      water-plants. The spring which feeds it is yonder in that big tuft of
      herbage. And when this trench has been opened to the edge of the slope,
      you will see the pond dry up, and the spring gush forth and take its
      course, carrying the beneficent water away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;may it fertilize all that stony expanse, for nothing
      can be sadder than dead land. How happy it will be to quench its thirst
      and live again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she broke off to scold Gervais: &ldquo;Come, young gentleman, don&rsquo;t pull so
      hard,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Wait till it comes; you know very well that it&rsquo;s all for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the blows of the pickaxes rang out, the trench rapidly made its
      way through the fat, moist soil, and soon the water would flow into the
      parched veins of the neighboring sandy tracts to endow them with
      fruitfulness. And the light trickling of the mother&rsquo;s milk also continued
      with the faint murmur of an inexhaustible source, flowing from her breast
      into the mouth of her babe, like a fountain of eternal life. It ever and
      ever flowed, it created flesh, intelligence, and labor, and strength. And
      soon its whispering would mingle with the babble of the delivered spring
      as it descended along the trenches to the dry hot lands. And at last there
      would be but one and the same stream, one and the same river, gradually
      overflowing and carrying life to all the earth, a mighty river of
      nourishing milk flowing through the world&rsquo;s veins, creating without a
      pause, and producing yet more youth and more health at each return of
      springtide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four months later, when Mathieu and his men had finished the autumn
      ploughing, there came the sowing on the same spot. Marianne was there
      again, and it was such a very mild gray day that she was still able to sit
      down, and once more gayly give the breast to little Gervais. He was
      already eight months old and had become quite a personage. He grew a
      little more every day, always in his mother&rsquo;s arms, on that warm breast
      whence he sucked life. He was like the seed which clings to the seed-pod
      so long as it is not ripe. And at that first quiver of November, that
      approach of winter through which the germs would slumber in the furrows,
      he pressed his chilly little face close to his mother&rsquo;s warm bosom, and
      nursed on in silence as if the river of life were lost, buried deep
      beneath the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Marianne, laughing, &ldquo;you are not warm, young gentleman, are
      you? It is time for you to take up your winter quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mathieu, with his sower&rsquo;s bag at his waist, was returning
      towards them, scattering the seed with broad rhythmical gestures. He had
      heard his wife, and he paused to say to her: &ldquo;Let him nurse and sleep till
      the sun comes back. He will be a man by harvest time.&rdquo; And, pointing to
      the great field which he was sowing with his assistants, he added: &ldquo;All
      this will grow and ripen when our Gervais has begun to walk and talk&mdash;just
      look, see our conquest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was proud of it. From ten to fifteen acres of the plateau were now rid
      of the stagnant pools, cleared and levelled; and they spread out in a
      brown expanse, rich with humus, while the water-furrows which intersected
      them carried the streams to the neighboring slopes. Before cultivating
      those dry lands one must yet wait until the moisture should have
      penetrated and fertilized them. That would be the work of the future, and
      thus, by degrees, life would be diffused through the whole estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening is coming on,&rdquo; resumed Mathieu, &ldquo;I must make haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he set off again, throwing the seed with his broad rhythmical
      gesture. And while Marianne, gravely smiling, watched him go, it occurred
      to little Rose to follow in his track, and take up handfuls of earth,
      which she scattered to the wind. The three boys perceived her, and Blaise
      and Denis then hastened up, followed by Ambroise, all gleefully imitating
      their father&rsquo;s gesture, and darting hither and thither around him. And for
      a moment it was almost as if Mathieu with the sweep of his arm not only
      cast the seed of expected corn into the furrows, but also sowed those dear
      children, casting them here and there without cessation, so that a whole
      nation of little sowers should spring up and finish populating the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months more went by, and January had arrived with a hard frost, when
      one day the Froments unexpectedly received a visit from Seguin and
      Beauchene, who had come to try their luck at wild-duck shooting, among
      such of the ponds on the plateau as had not yet been drained. It was a
      Sunday, and the whole family was gathered in the roomy kitchen, cheered by
      a big fire. Through the clear windows one could see the far-spreading
      countryside, white with rime, and stiffly slumbering under that crystal
      casing, like some venerated saint awaiting April&rsquo;s resurrection. And, that
      day, when the visitors presented themselves, Gervais also was slumbering
      in his white cradle, rendered somnolent by the season, but plump even as
      larks are in the cold weather, and waiting, he also, simply for life&rsquo;s
      revival, in order to reappear in all the triumph of his acquired strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had gayly partaken of dejeuner, and now, before nightfall, the
      four children had gathered round a table by the window, absorbed in a
      playful occupation which delighted them. Helped by Ambroise, the twins,
      Blaise and Denis, were building a whole village out of pieces of
      cardboard, fixed together with paste. There were houses, a town hall, a
      church, a school. And Rose, who had been forbidden to touch the scissors,
      presided over the paste, with which she smeared herself even to her hair.
      In the deep quietude, through which their laughter rang at intervals,
      their father and mother had remained seated side by side in front of the
      blazing fire, enjoying that delightful Sunday peace after the week&rsquo;s hard
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lived there very simply, like genuine peasants, without any luxury,
      any amusement, save that of being together. Their gay, bright kitchen was
      redolent of that easy primitive life, lived so near the earth, which frees
      one from fictitious wants, ambition, and the longing for pleasure. And no
      fortune, no power could have brought such quiet delight as that afternoon
      of happy intimacy, while the last-born slept so soundly and quietly that
      one could not even hear him breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene and Seguin broke in upon the quiet like unlucky sportsmen, with
      their limbs weary and their faces and hands icy cold. Amid the
      exclamations of surprise which greeted them, they complained of the folly
      that had possessed them to venture out of Paris in such bleak weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fancy, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Beauchene, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t seen a single
      duck! It&rsquo;s no doubt too cold. And you can&rsquo;t imagine what a bitter wind
      blows on the plateau, amid those ponds and bushes bristling with icicles.
      So we gave up the idea of any shooting. You must give us each a glass of
      hot wine, and then we&rsquo;ll get back to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seguin, who was in even a worse humor, stood before the fire trying to
      thaw himself; and while Marianne made haste to warm some wine, he began to
      speak of the cleared fields which he had skirted. Under the icy covering,
      however, beneath which they stiffly slumbered, hiding the seed within
      them, he had guessed nothing of the truth, and already felt anxious about
      this business of Mathieu&rsquo;s, which looked anything but encouraging. Indeed,
      he already feared that he would not be paid his purchase money, and so
      made bold to speak ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, my dear fellow, I am afraid you have lost your time,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;I
      noticed it all as I went by, and it did not seem promising. But how can
      you hope to reap anything from rotten soil in which only reeds have been
      growing for centuries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must wait,&rdquo; Mathieu quietly answered. &ldquo;You must come back and see it
      all next June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchene interrupted them. &ldquo;There is a train at four o&rsquo;clock, I
      think,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let us make haste, for it would annoy us tremendously to
      miss it, would it not, Seguin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he gave him a gay, meaning glance. They had doubtless planned
      some little spree together, like husbands bent on availing themselves to
      the utmost of the convenient pretext of a day&rsquo;s shooting. Then, having
      drunk some wine and feeling warmed and livelier, they began to express
      astonishment at their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It stupefies me, my dear fellow,&rdquo; declared Beauchene, &ldquo;that you can live
      in this awful solitude in the depth of winter. It is enough to kill
      anybody. I am all in favor of work, you know; but, dash it! one must have
      some amusement too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we do amuse ourselves,&rdquo; said Mathieu, waving his hand round that
      rustic kitchen in which centred all their pleasant family life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two visitors followed his gesture, and gazed in amazement at the walls
      covered with utensils, at the rough furniture, and at the table on which
      the children were still building their village after offering their cheeks
      to be kissed. No doubt they were unable to understand what pleasure there
      could possibly be there, for, suppressing a jeering laugh, they shook
      their heads. To them it was really an extraordinary life, a life of most
      singular taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see my little Gervais,&rdquo; said Marianne softly. &ldquo;He is asleep;
      mind, you must not wake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For politeness&rsquo; sake they both bent over the cradle, and expressed
      surprise at finding a child but ten months old so big. He was very good,
      too. Only, as soon as he should wake, he would no doubt deafen everybody.
      And then, too, if a fine child like that sufficed to make life happy, how
      many people must be guilty of spoiling their lives! The visitors came back
      to the fireside, anxious only to be gone now that they felt enlivened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s understood,&rdquo; said Mathieu, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t stay to dinner with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed!&rdquo; they exclaimed in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to attenuate the discourtesy of such a cry, Beauchene began to jest,
      and accepted the invitation for a later date when the warm weather should
      have arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word of honor, we have business in Paris,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But I
      promise you that when it&rsquo;s fine we will all come and spend a day here&mdash;yes,
      with our wives and children. And you will then show us your work, and we
      shall see if you have succeeded. So good-by! All my good wishes, my dear
      fellow! Au revoir, cousin! Au revoir, children; be good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came more kisses and hand-shakes, and the two men disappeared. And
      when the gentle silence had fallen once more Mathieu and Marianne again
      found themselves in front of the bright fire, while the children completed
      the building of their village with a great consumption of paste, and
      Gervais continued sleeping soundly. Had they been dreaming? Mathieu
      wondered. What sudden blast from all the shame and suffering of Paris had
      blown into their far-away quiet? Outside, the country retained its icy
      rigidity. The fire alone sang the song of hope in life&rsquo;s future revival.
      And, all at once, after a few minutes&rsquo; reverie the young man began to
      speak aloud, as if he had at last just found the answer to all sorts of
      grave questions which he had long since put to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those folks don&rsquo;t love; they are incapable of loving! Money, power,
      ambition, pleasure&mdash;yes, all those things may be theirs, but not
      love! Even the husbands who deceive their wives do not really love their
      mistresses. They have never glowed with the supreme desire, the divine
      desire which is the world&rsquo;s very soul, the brazier of eternal life. And
      that explains everything. Without desire there is no love, no courage, and
      no hope. By love alone can one create. And if love be restricted in its
      mission there is but failure. Yes, they lie and deceive, because they do
      not love. Then they suffer and lapse into moral and physical degradation.
      And at the end lies the collapse of our rotten society, which breaks up
      more and more each day before our eyes. That, then, is the truth I was
      seeking. It is desire and love that save. Whoever loves and creates is the
      revolutionary saviour, the maker of men for the new world which will
      shortly dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Mathieu so plainly understood that he and his wife were
      different from others. This now struck him with extraordinary force.
      Comparisons ensued, and he realized that their simple life, free from the
      lust of wealth, their contempt for luxury and worldly vanities, all their
      common participation in toil which made them accept and glorify life and
      its duties, all that mode of existence of theirs which was at once their
      joy and their strength, sprang solely from the source of eternal energy:
      the love with which they glowed. If, later on, victory should remain with
      them, if they should some day leave behind them work of value and health
      and happiness, it would be solely because they had possessed the power of
      love and the courage to love freely, harvesting, in an ever-increasing
      family, both the means of support and the means of conquest. And this
      sudden conviction filled Mathieu with such a glow that he leant towards
      his wife, who sat there deeply moved by what he said, and kissed her
      ardently upon the lips. It was divine love passing like a flaming blast.
      But she, though her own eyes were sparkling, laughingly scolded him,
      saying: &ldquo;Hush, hush, you will wake Gervais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they remained there hand in hand, pressing each other&rsquo;s fingers amid
      the silence. Evening was coming on, and at last the children, their
      village finished, raised cries of rapture at seeing it standing there
      among bits of wood, which figured trees. And then the softened glances of
      the parents strayed now through the window towards the crops sleeping
      beneath the crystalline rime, and now towards their last-born&rsquo;s cradle,
      where hope was likewise slumbering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again did two long months go by. Gervais had just completed his first
      year, and fine weather, setting in early, was hastening the awaking of the
      earth. One morning, when Marianne and the children went to join Mathieu on
      the plateau, they raised shouts of wonder, so completely had the sun
      transformed the expanse in a single week. It was now all green velvet, a
      thick endless carpet of sprouting corn, of tender, delicate emerald hue.
      Never had such a marvellous crop been seen. And thus, as the family walked
      on through the mild, radiant April morning, amid the country now roused
      from winter&rsquo;s sleep, and quivering with fresh youth, they all waxed merry
      at the sight of that healthfulness, that progressing fruitfulness, which
      promised the fulfilment of all their hopes. And their rapture yet
      increased when, all at once, they noticed that little Gervais also was
      awaking to life, acquiring decisive strength. As he struggled in his
      little carriage and his mother removed him from it, behold! he took his
      flight, and, staggering, made four steps; then hung to his father&rsquo;s legs
      with his little fists. A cry of extraordinary delight burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! he walks, he walks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! those first lispings of life, those successive flights of the dear
      little ones; the first glance, the first smile, the first step&mdash;what
      joy do they not bring to parents&rsquo; hearts! They are the rapturous <i>etapes</i>
      of infancy, for which father and mother watch, which they await
      impatiently, which they hail with exclamations of victory, as if each were
      a conquest, a fresh triumphal entry into life. The child grows, the child
      becomes a man. And there is yet the first tooth, forcing its way like a
      needle-point through rosy gums; and there is also the first stammered
      word, the &ldquo;pa-pa,&rdquo; the &ldquo;mam-ma,&rdquo; which one is quite ready to detect amid
      the vaguest babble, though it be but the purring of a kitten, the chirping
      of a bird. Life does its work, and the father and the mother are ever
      wonderstruck with admiration and emotion at the sight of that
      efflorescence alike of their flesh and their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;he will come back to me. Gervais!
      Gervais!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after a little hesitation, a false start, the child did indeed return,
      taking the four steps afresh, with arms extended and beating the air as if
      they were balancing-poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gervais! Gervais!&rdquo; called Mathieu in his turn. And the child went back to
      him; and again and again did they want him to repeat the journey, amid
      their mirthful cries, so pretty and so funny did they find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeing that the four other children began playing rather roughly
      with him in their enthusiasm, Marianne carried him away. And once more, on
      the same spot, on the young grass, did she give him the breast. And again
      did the stream of milk trickle forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by that spot, skirting the new field, there passed a crossroad, in
      rather bad condition, leading to a neighboring village. And on this road a
      cart suddenly came into sight, jolting amid the ruts, and driven by a
      peasant&mdash;who was so absorbed in his contemplation of the land which
      Mathieu had cleared, that he would have let his horse climb upon a heap of
      stones had not a woman who accompanied him abruptly pulled the reins. The
      horse then stopped, and the man in a jeering voice called out: &ldquo;So this,
      then, is your work, Monsieur Froment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Marianne thereupon recognized the Lepailleurs, the people of
      the mill. They were well aware that folks laughed at Janville over the
      folly of their attempt&mdash;that mad idea of growing wheat among the
      marshes of the plateau. Lepailleur, in particular, distinguished himself
      by the violent raillery he levelled at this Parisian, a gentleman born,
      with a good berth, who was so stupid as to make himself a peasant, and
      fling what money he had to that rascally earth, which would assuredly
      swallow him and his children and his money all together, without yielding
      even enough wheat to keep them in bread. And thus the sight of the field
      had stupefied him. It was a long while since he had passed that way, and
      he had never thought that the seed would sprout so thickly, for he had
      repeated a hundred times that nothing would germinate, so rotten was all
      the land. Although he almost choked with covert anger at seeing his
      predictions thus falsified, he was unwilling to admit his error, and put
      on an air of ironical doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think it will grow, eh? Well, one can&rsquo;t say that it hasn&rsquo;t come
      up. Only one must see if it can stand and ripen.&rdquo; And as Mathieu quietly
      smiled with hope and confidence, he added, striving to poison his joy:
      &ldquo;Ah! when you know the earth you&rsquo;ll find what a hussy she is. I&rsquo;ve seen
      plenty of crops coming on magnificently, and then a storm, a gust of wind,
      a mere trifle, has reduced them to nothing! But you are young at the trade
      as yet; you&rsquo;ll get your experience in misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife, who nodded approval on hearing him talk so finely, then
      addressed herself to Marianne: &ldquo;Oh! my man doesn&rsquo;t say that to discourage
      you, madame. But the land you know, is just like children. There are some
      who live and some who die; some who give one pleasure, and others who kill
      one with grief. But, all considered, one always bestows more on them than
      one gets back, and in the end one finds oneself duped. You&rsquo;ll see, you&rsquo;ll
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, Marianne, moved by these malicious predictions, gently
      raised her trustful eyes to Mathieu. And he, though for a moment irritated
      by all the ignorance, envy, and imbecile ambition which he felt were
      before him, contented himself with jesting. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;ll see. When
      your son Antoine becomes a prefect, and I have twelve peasant daughters
      ready, I&rsquo;ll invite you to their weddings, for it&rsquo;s your mill that ought to
      be rebuilt, you know, and provided with a fine engine, so as to grind all
      the corn of my property yonder, left and right, everywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sweep of his arm embraced such a far expanse of ground that the
      miller, who did not like to be derided, almost lost his temper. He lashed
      his horse with his whip, and the cart jolted on again through the ruts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheat in the ear is not wheat in the mill,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Au revoir, and good
      luck to you, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the children still ran about, seeking early primroses among
      the mosses, Mathieu came and sat down beside Marianne, who, he saw, was
      quivering. He said nothing to her, for he knew that she possessed
      sufficient strength and confidence to surmount, unaided, such fears for
      the future as threats might kindle in her womanly heart. But he simply set
      himself there, so near her that he touched her, looking and smiling at her
      the while. And she immediately became calm again and likewise smiled,
      while little Gervais, whom the words of the malicious could not as yet
      disturb, nursed more eagerly than ever, with a purr of rapturous
      satisfaction. The milk was ever trickling, bringing flesh to little limbs
      which grew stronger day by day, spreading through the earth, filling the
      whole world, nourishing the life which increased hour by hour. And was not
      this the answer which faith and hope returned to all threats of death?&mdash;the
      certainty of life&rsquo;s victory, with fine children ever growing in the
      sunlight, and fine crops ever rising from the soil at each returning
      spring! To-morrow, yet once again, on the glorious day of harvest, the
      corn will have ripened, the children will be men!
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was thus, indeed, three months later, when the Beauchenes and the
      Seguins, keeping their promise, came&mdash;husbands, wives, and children&mdash;to
      spend a Sunday afternoon at Chantebled. The Froments had even prevailed on
      Morange to be of the party with Reine, in their desire to draw him for a
      day, at any rate, from the dolorous prostration in which he lived. As soon
      as all these fine folks had alighted from the train it was decided to go
      up to the plateau to see the famous fields, for everybody was curious
      about them, so extravagant and inexplicable did the idea of Mathieu&rsquo;s
      return to the soil, and transformation into a peasant, seem to them. He
      laughed gayly, and at least he succeeded in surprising them when he waved
      his hand towards the great expanse under the broad blue sky, that sea of
      tall green stalks whose ears were already heavy and undulated at the
      faintest breeze. That warm splendid afternoon, the far-spreading fields
      looked like the very triumph of fruitfulness, a growth of germs which the
      humus amassed through centuries had nourished with prodigious sap, thus
      producing this first formidable crop, as if to glorify the eternal source
      of life which sleeps in the earth&rsquo;s flanks. The milk had streamed, and the
      corn now grew on all sides with overflowing energy, creating health and
      strength, bespeaking man&rsquo;s labor and the kindliness, the solidarity of the
      world. It was like a beneficent, nourishing ocean, in which all hunger
      would be appeased, and in which to-morrow might arise, amid that tide of
      wheat whose waves were ever carrying good news to the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, neither Constance nor Valentine was greatly touched by the sight of
      the waving wheat, for other ambitions filled their minds: and Morange,
      though he stared with his vague dim eyes, did not even seem to see it. But
      Beauchene and Seguin marvelled, for they remembered their visit in the
      month of January, when the frozen ground had been wrapt in sleep and
      mystery. They had then guessed nothing, and now they were amazed at this
      miraculous awakening, this conquering fertility, which had changed a part
      of the marshy tableland into a field of living wealth. And Seguin, in
      particular, did not cease praising and admiring, certain as he now felt
      that he would be paid, and already hoping that Mathieu would soon take a
      further portion of the estate off his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as soon as they had walked to the old pavilion, now transformed into
      a little farm, and had seated themselves in the garden, pending
      dinner-time, the conversation fell upon children. Marianne, as it
      happened, had weaned Gervais the day before, and he was there among the
      ladies, still somewhat unsteady on his legs, and yet boldly going from one
      to the other, careless of his frequent falls on his back or his nose. He
      was a gay-spirited child who seldom lost his temper, doubtless because his
      health was so good. His big clear eyes were ever laughing; he offered his
      little hands in a friendly way, and was very white, very pink, and very
      sturdy&mdash;quite a little man indeed, though but fifteen and a half
      months old. Constance and Valentine admired him, while Marianne jested and
      turned him away each time that he greedily put out his little hands
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, monsieur, it&rsquo;s over now. You will have nothing but soup in
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weaning is such a terrible business,&rdquo; then remarked Constance. &ldquo;Did he
      let you sleep last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, he had good habits, you know; he never troubled me at night. But
      this morning he was stupefied and began to cry. Still, you see, he is
      fairly well behaved already. Besides, I never had more trouble than this
      with the other ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene was standing there, listening, and, as usual, smoking a cigar.
      Constance appealed to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky. But you, dear, remember&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;what a life
      Maurice led us when his nurse went away. For three whole nights we were
      unable to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But just look how your Maurice is playing!&rdquo; exclaimed Beauchene. &ldquo;Yet
      you&rsquo;ll be telling me again that he is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I no longer say that, my friend; he is quite well now. Besides, I was
      never anxious; I know that he is very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great game of hide-and-seek was going on in the garden, along the paths
      and even over the flower-beds, among the eight children who were assembled
      there. Besides the four of the house&mdash;Blaise, Denis, Ambroise, and
      Rose&mdash;there were Gaston and Lucie, the two elder children of the
      Seguins, who had abstained, however, from bringing their other daughter&mdash;little
      Andree. Then, too, both Reine and Maurice were present. And the latter
      now, indeed, seemed to be all right upon his legs, though his square face
      with its heavy jaw still remained somewhat pale. His mother watched him
      running about, and felt so happy and so vain at the realization of her
      dream that she became quite amiable even towards these poor relatives the
      Froments, whose retirement into the country seemed to her like an
      incomprehensible downfall, which forever thrust them out of her social
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; resumed Beauchene, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only one boy, but he&rsquo;s a sturdy
      fellow, I warrant it; isn&rsquo;t he, Mathieu?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words had scarcely passed his lips when he must have regretted them.
      His eyelids quivered and a little chill came over him as his glance met
      that of his former designer. For in the latter&rsquo;s clear eyes he beheld, as
      it were, a vision of that other son, Norine&rsquo;s ill-fated child, who had
      been cast into the unknown. Then there came a pause, and amid the shrill
      cries of the boys and girls playing at hide-and-seek a number of little
      shadows flitted through the sunlight: they were the shadows of the poor
      doomed babes who scarce saw the light before they were carried off from
      homes and hospitals to be abandoned in corners, and die of cold, and
      perhaps even of starvation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu had been unable to answer a word. And his emotion increased when
      he noticed Morange huddled up on a chair, and gazing with blurred, tearful
      eyes at little Gervais, who was laughingly toddling hither and thither.
      Had a vision come to him also? Had the phantom of his dead wife, shrinking
      from the duties of motherhood and murdered in a hateful den, risen before
      him in that sunlit garden, amid all the turbulent mirth of happy, playful
      children?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty girl your daughter Reine is!&rdquo; said Mathieu, in the hope of
      drawing the accountant from his haunting remorse. &ldquo;Just look at her
      running about!&mdash;so girlish still, as if she were not almost old
      enough to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange slowly raised his head and looked at his daughter. And a smile
      returned to his eyes, still moist with tears. Day by day his adoration
      increased. As Reine grew up he found her more and more like her mother,
      and all his thoughts became centred in her. His one yearning was that she
      might be very beautiful, very happy, very rich. That would be a sign that
      he was forgiven&mdash;that would be the only joy for which he could yet
      hope. And amid it all there was a vague feeling of jealousy at the thought
      that a husband would some day take her from him, and that he would remain
      alone in utter solitude, alone with the phantom of his dead wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;oh! not yet. She is only fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the others expressed surprise: they would have taken her to be
      quite eighteen, so womanly was her precocious beauty already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; resumed her father, feeling flattered, &ldquo;she has
      already been asked in marriage. You know that the Baroness de Lowicz is
      kind enough to take her out now and then. Well, she told me that an
      arch-millionnaire had fallen in love with Reine&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll have to
      wait! I shall still be able to keep her to myself for another five or six
      years at least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He no longer wept, but gave a little laugh of egotistical satisfaction,
      without noticing the chill occasioned by the mention of Seraphine&rsquo;s name;
      for even Beauchene felt that his sister was hardly a fit companion for a
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Marianne, anxious at seeing the conversation drop, began, questioning
      Valentine, while Gervais at last slyly crept to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not bring your little Andree?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;I should have
      been so pleased to kiss her. And she would have been able to play with
      this little gentleman, who, you see, does not leave me a moment&rsquo;s peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Seguin did not give his wife time to reply. &ldquo;Ah! no, indeed!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed; &ldquo;in that case I should not have come. It is quite enough to
      have to drag the two others about. That fearful child has not ceased
      deafening us ever since her nurse went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine then explained that Andree was not really well behaved. She had
      been weaned at the beginning of the previous week, and La Catiche, after
      terrorizing the household for more than a year, had plunged it by her
      departure into anarchy. Ah! that Catiche, she might compliment herself on
      all the money she had cost! Sent away almost by force, like a queen who is
      bound to abdicate at last, she had been loaded with presents for herself
      and her husband, and her little girl at the village! And now it had been
      of little use to take a dry-nurse in her place, for Andree did not cease
      shrieking from morning till night. They had discovered, too, that La
      Catiche had not only carried off with her a large quantity of linen, but
      had left the other servants quite spoilt, disorganized, so that a general
      clearance seemed necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; resumed Marianne, as if to smooth things, &ldquo;when the children are
      well one can overlook other worries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you imagine that Andree is well?&rdquo; cried Seguin, giving way to one
      of his brutal fits. &ldquo;That Catiche certainly set her right at first, but I
      don&rsquo;t know what happened afterwards, for now she is simply skin and
      bones.&rdquo; Then, as his wife wished to protest, he lost his temper. &ldquo;Do you
      mean to say that I don&rsquo;t speak the truth? Why, look at our two others
      yonder: they have papier-mache faces, too! It is evident that you don&rsquo;t
      look after them enough. You know what a poor opinion Santerre has of
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For him Santerre&rsquo;s opinion remained authoritative. However, Valentine
      contented herself with shrugging her shoulders; while the others, feeling
      slightly embarrassed, looked at Gaston and Lucie, who amid the romping of
      their companions, soon lost breath and lagged behind, sulky and
      distrustful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Constance to Valentine, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t our good
      Doctor Boutan tell you that all the trouble came from your not nursing
      your children yourself? At all events, that was the compliment that he
      paid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of Boutan a friendly shout arose. Oh! Boutan, Boutan! he
      was like all other specialists. Seguin sneered; Beauchene jested about the
      legislature decreeing compulsory nursing by mothers; and only Mathieu and
      Marianne remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my dear friend, we are not jesting about you,&rdquo; said Constance,
      turning towards the latter. &ldquo;Your children are superb, and nobody says the
      contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne gayly waved her hand, as if to reply that they were free to make
      fun of her if they pleased. But at this moment she perceived that Gervais,
      profiting by her inattention, was busy seeking his &ldquo;paradise lost.&rdquo; And
      thereupon she set him on the ground: &ldquo;Ah, no, no, monsieur!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I have told you that it is all over. Can&rsquo;t you see that people
      would laugh at us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for her and her husband came a delightful moment. He was looking at
      her with deep emotion. Her duty accomplished, she was now returning to
      him, for she was spouse as well as mother. Never had he thought her so
      beautiful, possessed of so strong and so calm a beauty, radiant with the
      triumph of happy motherhood, as though indeed a spark of something divine
      had been imparted to her by that river of milk that had streamed from her
      bosom. A song of glory seemed to sound, glory to the source of life, glory
      to the true mother, to the one who nourishes, her travail o&rsquo;er. For there
      is none other; the rest are imperfect and cowardly, responsible for
      incalculable disasters. And on seeing her thus, in that glory, amid her
      vigorous children, like the good goddess of Fruitfulness, Mathieu felt
      that he adored her. Divine passion swept by&mdash;the glow which makes the
      fields palpitate, which rolls on through the waters, and floats in the
      wind, begetting millions and millions of existences. And &lsquo;twas delightful
      the ecstasy into which they both sank, forgetfulness of all else, of all
      those others who were there. They saw them no longer; they felt but one
      desire, to say that they loved each other, and that the season had come
      when love blossoms afresh. His lips protruded, she offered hers, and then
      they kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t disturb yourselves!&rdquo; cried Beauchene merrily. &ldquo;Why, what is the
      matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like us to move away?&rdquo; added Seguin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Valentine laughed wildly, and Constance put on a prudish air,
      Morange, in whose voice tears were again rising, spoke these words,
      fraught with supreme regret: &ldquo;Ah! you are right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astonished at what they had done, without intention of doing it, Mathieu
      and Marianne remained for a moment speechless, looking at one another in
      consternation. And then they burst into a hearty laugh, gayly excusing
      themselves. To love! to love! to be able to love! Therein lies all health,
      all will, and all power.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOUR years went by. And during those four years Mathieu and Marianne had
      two more children, a daughter at the end of the first year and a son at
      the expiration of the third. And each time that the family thus increased,
      the estate at Chantebled was increased also&mdash;on the first occasion by
      fifty more acres of rich soil reclaimed among the marshes of the plateau,
      and the second time by an extensive expanse of wood and moorland which the
      springs were beginning to fertilize. It was the resistless conquest of
      life, it was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight, it was labor ever
      incessantly pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and suffering,
      making good all losses, and at each succeeding hour setting more energy,
      more health, and more joy in the veins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when Mathieu called on Seguin to purchase the wood and
      moorland, he lunched with Dr. Boutan, whom he found in an execrable humor.
      The doctor had just heard that three of his former patients had lately
      passed through the hands of his colleague Gaude, the notorious surgeon to
      whose clinic at the Marbeuf Hospital society Paris flocked as to a
      theatre. One of these patients was none other than Euphrasie, old
      Moineaud&rsquo;s eldest daughter, now married to Auguste Benard, a mason, and
      already the mother of three children. She had doubtless resumed her usual
      avocations too soon after the birth of her last child, as often happens in
      working-class families where the mother is unable to remain idle. At all
      events, she had for some time been ailing, and had finally been removed to
      the hospital. Mathieu had for a while employed her young sister Cecile,
      now seventeen, as a servant in the house at Chantebled, but she was of
      poor health and had returned to Paris, where, curiously enough, she also
      entered Doctor Gaude&rsquo;s clinic. And Boutan waxed indignant at the methods
      which Gaude employed. The two sisters, the married woman and the girl, had
      been discharged as cured, and so far, this might seem to be the case; but
      time, in Boutan&rsquo;s opinion, would bring round some terrible revenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      One curious point of the affair was that Beauchene&rsquo;s dissolute sister,
      Seraphine, having heard of these so-called cures, which the newspapers had
      widely extolled, had actually sought out the Benards and the Moineauds to
      interview Euphrasie and Cecile on the subject. And in the result she
      likewise had placed herself in Gaude&rsquo;s hands. She certainly was of little
      account, and, whatever might become of her, the world would be none the
      poorer by her death. But Boutan pointed out that during the fifteen years
      that Gaude&rsquo;s theories and practices had prevailed in France, no fewer than
      half a million women had been treated accordingly, and, in the vast
      majority of cases, without any such treatment being really necessary.
      Moreover, Boutan spoke feelingly of the after results of such treatment&mdash;comparative
      health for a few brief years, followed in some cases by a total loss of
      muscular energy, and in others by insanity of a most violent form; so that
      the padded cells of the madhouses were filling year by year with the
      unhappy women who had passed through the hands of Gaude and his
      colleagues. From a social point of view also the effects were disastrous.
      They ran counter to all Boutan&rsquo;s own theories, and blasted all his hopes
      of living to see France again holding a foremost place among the nations
      of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he to Mathieu, &ldquo;if people were only like you and your good
      wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During those four years at Chantebled the Froments had been ever founding,
      creating, increasing, and multiplying, again and again proving victorious
      in the eternal battle which life wages against death, thanks to that
      continual increase both of offspring and of fertile land which was like
      their very existence, their joy and their strength. Desire passed like a
      gust of flame&mdash;desire divine and fruitful, since they possessed the
      power of love, kindliness, and health. And their energy did the rest&mdash;that
      will of action, that quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that is
      necessary, the labor that has made and that regulates the earth. But
      during the first two years they had to struggle incessantly. There were
      two disastrous winters with snow and ice, and March brought hail-storms
      and hurricanes which left the crops lying low. Even as Lepailleur had
      threateningly predicted with a laugh of impotent envy, it seemed as if the
      earth meant to prove a bad mother, ungrateful to them for their toil,
      indifferent to their losses. During those two years they only extricated
      themselves from trouble thanks to the second fifty acres that they
      purchased from Seguin, to the west of the plateau, a fresh expanse of rich
      soil which they reclaimed amid the marshes, and which, in spite of frost
      and hail, yielded a prodigious first harvest. As the estate gradually
      expanded, it also grew stronger, better able to bear ill-luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu and Marianne also had great family worries. Their five elder
      children gave them much anxiety, much fatigue. As with the soil, here
      again there was a daily battle, endless cares and endless fears. Little
      Gervais was stricken with fever and narrowly escaped death. Rose, too, one
      day filled them with the direst alarm, for she fell from a tree in their
      presence, but fortunately with no worse injury than a sprain. And, on the
      other hand, they were happy in the three others, Blaise, Denis, and
      Ambroise, who proved as healthy as young oak-trees. And when Marianne gave
      birth to her sixth child, on whom they bestowed the gay name of Claire,
      Mathieu celebrated the new pledge of their affection by further
      acquisitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, during the two ensuing years, their battles and sadness and joy all
      resulted in victory once more. Marianne gave birth, and Mathieu conquered
      new lands. There was ever much labor, much life expended, and much life
      realized and harvested. This time it was a question of enlarging the
      estate on the side of the moorlands, the sandy, gravelly slopes where
      nothing had grown for centuries. The captured sources of the tableland,
      directed towards those uncultivated tracts, gradually fertilized them,
      covered them with increasing vegetation. There were partial failures at
      first, and defeat even seemed possible, so great was the patient
      determination which the creative effort demanded. But here, too, the crops
      at last overflowed, while the intelligent felling of a part of the
      purchased woods resulted in a large profit, and gave Mathieu an idea of
      cultivating some of the spacious clearings hitherto overgrown with
      brambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while the estate spread the children grew. It had been necessary to
      send the three elder ones&mdash;Blaise, Denis, and Ambroise&mdash;to a
      school in Paris, whither they gallantly repaired each day by the first
      train, returning only in the evening. But the three others, little Gervais
      and the girls Rose and Claire, were still allowed all freedom in the midst
      of Nature. Marianne, however, gave birth to a seventh child, amid
      circumstances which caused Mathieu keen anxiety. For a moment, indeed, he
      feared that he might lose her. But her healthful temperament triumphed
      over all, and the child&mdash;a boy, named Gregoire&mdash;soon drank life
      and strength from her breast, as from the very source of existence. When
      Mathieu saw his wife smiling again with that dear little one in her arms,
      he embraced her passionately, and triumphed once again over every sorrow
      and every pang. Yet another child, yet more wealth and power, yet an
      additional force born into the world, another field ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s
      harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas ever the great work, the good work, the work of fruitfulness
      spreading, thanks to the earth and to woman, both victorious over
      destruction, offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child
      was born, and loving, willing, battling, toiling even amid suffering, and
      ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      Then two more years rolled on. And during those two years Mathieu and
      Marianne had yet another child, a girl. And again, at the same time as the
      family increased, the estate of Chantebled was increased also&mdash;on one
      side by five-and-seventy acres of woodland stretching over the plateau as
      far as the fields of Mareuil, and on the other by five-and-seventy acres
      of sloping moorland, extending to the village of Monval, alongside the
      railway line. But the principal change was that, as the old hunting-box,
      the little dilapidated pavilion, no longer offered sufficient
      accommodation, a whole farmstead had to be erected&mdash;stone buildings,
      and barns, and sheds, and stables, and cowhouses&mdash;for farm hands and
      crops and animals, whose number increased at each enlargement of the
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the resistless conquest of life; it was fruitfulness spreading in
      the sunlight; it was labor ever incessantly pursuing its work of creation
      amid obstacles and suffering, ever making good all losses, and at each
      succeeding hour setting more energy, more health, and more joy in the
      veins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during those two years, while Chantebled grew, while labor and worry
      and victory alternated, Mathieu suddenly found himself mixed up in a
      terribly tragedy. He was obliged to come to Paris at times&mdash;more
      often indeed than he cared&mdash;now through his business relations with
      Seguin, now to sell, now to buy, now to order one thing or another. He
      often purchased implements and appliances at the Beauchene works, and had
      thus kept up intercourse with Morange, who once more seemed a changed man.
      Time had largely healed the wound left by his wife&rsquo;s death, particularly
      as she seemed to live again in Reine, to whom he was more attached than
      ever. Reine was no longer a child; she had become a woman. Still her
      father hoped to keep her with him some years yet, while working with all
      diligence, saving and saving every penny that he could spare, in order to
      increase her dowry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inevitable was on the march, for the girl had become the constant
      companion of Seraphine. The latter, however depraved she might be, had
      certainly in the first instance entertained no idea of corrupting the
      child whom she patronized. She had at first taken her solely to such
      places of amusement as were fit for her years and understanding. But
      little by little the descent had come. Reine, too, as she grew into a
      woman, amid the hours of idleness when she was left alone by her father&mdash;who,
      perforce, had to spend his days at the Beauchene works&mdash;developed an
      ardent temperament and a thirst for every frivolous pleasure. And by
      degrees the once simply petted child became a participator in Seraphine&rsquo;s
      own reckless and dissolute life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the end came, and Reine found herself in dire trouble because of a
      high State functionary, a married man, a friend of Seraphine&rsquo;s&mdash;both
      women quite lost their heads. Such a blow might kill Morange. Everything
      must be hidden from him; but how? Thereupon Seraphine devised a plan. She
      obtained permission for Reine to accompany her on a visit into the
      country; but while the fond father imagined that his daughter was enjoying
      herself among society folk at a chateau in the Loiret, she was really
      hiding in Paris. It was indeed a repetition of her mother&rsquo;s tragic story,
      with this difference&mdash;that Seraphine addressed herself to no vulgar
      Madame Rouche, but to an assistant of her own surgeon, Gaude, a certain
      Sarraille, who had a dingy den of a clinic in the Passage Tivoli.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright day in August, and Mathieu, who had come to Paris to make
      some purchases at the Beauchene works, was lunching alone with Morange at
      the latter&rsquo;s flat, when Seraphine arrived there breathless and in
      consternation. Reine, she said, had been taken ill in the country, and she
      had brought her back to Paris to her own flat. But it was not thither; it
      was to Sarraille&rsquo;s den that she drove Morange and Mathieu. And there the
      frightful scene which had been enacted at La Rouche&rsquo;s at the time of
      Valerie&rsquo;s death was repeated. Reine, too, was dead&mdash;dead like her
      mother! And Morange, in a first outburst of fury threatened both Seraphine
      and Sarraille with the scaffold. For half an hour there was no mastering
      him, but all at once he broke down. To lose his daughter as he had lost
      his wife, it was too appalling; the blow was too great; he had strength
      left only to weep. Sarraille, moreover, defended himself; he swore that he
      had known nothing of the truth, that the deceased had simply come to him
      for legitimate treatment, and that both she and the Baroness had deceived
      him. Then Seraphine on her side took hold of Morange&rsquo;s hands, protesting
      her devotion, her frightful grief, her fear, too, lest the reputation of
      the poor dear girl should be dragged through the mire, if he (the father)
      did not keep the terrible secret. She accepted her share of responsibility
      and blame, admitted that she had been very culpable, and spoke of eternal
      remorse. But might the terrible truth be buried in the dead girl&rsquo;s grave,
      might there be none but pure flowers strewn upon that grave, might she who
      lay therein be regretted by all who had known her, as one snatched away in
      all innocence of youth and beauty!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Morange yielded to his weakness of heart, stifling the while with
      sobs, and scarce repeating that word &ldquo;Murderers!&rdquo; which had sprung from
      his lips so impulsively a little while before. He thought, too, of the
      scandal, an autopsy, a court of law, the newspapers recounting the crime,
      his daughter&rsquo;s memory covered with mire, and&mdash;No! no! he could have
      none of that. Whatever Seraphine might be, she had spoken rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his powerlessness to avenge his daughter completed his prostration.
      It was as if he had been beaten almost to the point of death; every one of
      his limbs was bruised, his head seemed empty, his heart cold and scarce
      able to beat. And he sank into a sort of second childhood, clasping his
      hands and stammering plaintively, terrified, and beseeching compassion,
      like one whose sufferings are too hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Mathieu sought to console him he muttered: &ldquo;Oh, it is all over.
      They have both gone, one after the other, and I alone am guilty. The first
      time it was I who lied to Reine, telling her that her mother was
      travelling; and then she in her turn lied to me the other day with that
      story of an invitation to a chateau in the country. Ah! if eight years ago
      I had only opposed my poor Valerie&rsquo;s madness, my poor Reine would still be
      alive to-day.... Yes, it is all my fault; I alone killed them by my
      weakness. I am their murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shivering, deathly cold, he went on amid his sobs: &ldquo;And, wretched fool
      that I have been, I have killed them through loving them too much. They
      were so beautiful, and it was so excusable for them to be rich and gay and
      happy. One after the other they took my heart from me, and I lived only in
      them and by them and for them. When one had left me, the other became my
      all in all, and for her, my daughter, I again indulged in the dream of
      ambition which had originated with her mother. And yet I killed them both,
      and my mad desire to rise and conquer fortune led me to that twofold
      crime. Ah! when I think that even this morning I still dared to esteem
      myself happy at having but that one child, that daughter to cherish! What
      foolish blasphemy against love and life! She is dead now, dead like her
      mother, and I am alone, with nobody to love and nobody to love me&mdash;neither
      wife nor daughter, neither desire nor will, but alone&mdash;ah! all alone,
      forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the cry of supreme abandonment that he raised, while sinking to the
      floor strengthless, with a great void within him; and all he could do was
      to press Mathieu&rsquo;s hands and stammer: &ldquo;Leave me&mdash;tell me nothing. You
      alone were right. I refused the offers of life, and life has now taken
      everything from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, in tears himself, kissed him and lingered yet a few moments
      longer in that tragic den, feeling more moved than he had ever felt
      before. And when he went off he left the unhappy Morange in the charge of
      Seraphine, who now treated him like a little ailing child whose will-power
      was entirely gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at Chantebled, as time went on, Mathieu and Marianne founded, created,
      increased, and multiplied. During the two years which elapsed, they again
      proved victorious in the eternal battle which life wages against death,
      thanks to that continual increase both of offspring and of fertile land
      which was like their very existence, their joy, and their strength. Desire
      passed like a gust of flame&mdash;desire divine and fruitful, since they
      possessed the power of love, kindliness, and health. And their energy did
      the rest&mdash;that will of action, that quiet bravery in the presence of
      the labor that is necessary, the labor that has made and that regulates
      the world. They were, however, still in the hard, trying, earlier stage of
      their work of conquest, and they often wept with grief and anxiety. Many
      were their cares, too, in transforming the old pavilion into a farm. The
      outlay was considerable, and at times it seemed as if the crops would
      never pay the building accounts. Moreover, as the enterprise grew in
      magnitude, and there came more and more cattle, more and more horses, a
      larger staff of both men and girls became necessary, to say nothing of
      additional implements and appliances, and the increase of supervision
      which left the Froments little rest. Mathieu controlled the agricultural
      part of the enterprise, ever seeking improved methods for drawing from the
      earth all the life that slumbered within it. And Marianne watched over the
      farmyard, the dairy, the poultry, and showed herself a first-class
      accountant, keeping the books, and receiving and paying money. And thus,
      in spite of recurring worries, strokes of bad luck and inevitable
      mistakes, fortune smiled on them athwart all worries and losses, so brave
      and sensible did they prove in their incessant daily struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart, too, from the new buildings, the estate was increased by
      five-and-seventy acres of woodland, and five-and-seventy acres of sandy
      sloping soil. Mathieu&rsquo;s battle with those sandy slopes became yet keener,
      more and more heroic as his field of action expanded; but he ended by
      conquering, by fertilizing them yet more each season, thanks to the
      fructifying springs which he directed through them upon every side. And in
      the same way he cut broad roads through the new woods which he purchased
      on the plateau, in order to increase the means of communication and carry
      into effect his idea of using the clearings as pasture for his cattle,
      pending the time when he might largely devote himself to stock-raising. In
      this wise, then, the battle went on, and spread incessantly in all
      directions; and the chances of decisive victory likewise increased,
      compensation for possible loss on one side being found on another where
      the harvest proved prodigious.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like the estate, the children also grew. Blaise and Denis, the twins,
      now already fourteen years of age, reaped prize after prize at school,
      putting their younger brother, Ambroise, slightly to shame, for his quick
      and ingenious mind was often busy with other matters than his lessons.
      Gervais, the girls Rose and Claire, as well as the last-born boy, little
      Gregoire, were yet too young to be trusted alone in Paris, and so they
      continued growing in the open air of the country, without any great mishap
      befalling them. And at the end of those two years Marianne gave birth to
      her eighth child, this time a girl, named Louise; and when Mathieu saw her
      smiling with the dear little babe in her arms, he embraced her
      passionately, and triumphed once again over every sorrow and every pang.
      Yet another child, yet more wealth and power, yet an additional force born
      into the world, another field ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas ever the great work, the good work, the work of fruitfulness
      spreading, thanks to the earth and thanks to woman, both victorious over
      destruction, offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child
      was born, and loving, willing, battling, toiling, even amid suffering, and
      ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *  *  *  *  *  *
</pre>
    <p>
      Then two more years rolled on, and during those two years Mathieu and
      Marianne had yet another child, another daughter, whom they called
      Madeleine. And once again the estate of Chantebled was increased; this
      time by all the marshland whose ponds and whose springs remained to be
      drained and captured on the west of the plateau. The whole of this part of
      the property was now acquired by the Froments&mdash;two hundred acres of
      land where, hitherto, only water plants had grown, but which now was given
      over to cultivation, and yielded abundant crops. And the new springs,
      turned into canals on every side, again carried beneficent life to the
      sandy slopes, and fertilized them. It was life&rsquo;s resistless conquest; it
      was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight; it was labor ever incessantly
      pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and suffering, making good
      all losses, and at each succeeding hour setting more energy, more health,
      and more joy in the veins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it was Seguin himself who asked Mathieu to purchase a fresh part
      of the estate, pressing him even to take all that was left of it, woods
      and moorland&mdash;extending over some five hundred acres. Nowadays Seguin
      was often in need of money, and in order to do business he offered Mathieu
      lower terms and all sorts of advantages; but the other prudently declined
      the proposals, keeping steadfastly to his original intentions, which were
      that he would proceed with his work of creation step by step, in
      accordance with his exact means and requirements. Moreover, a certain
      difficulty arose with regard to the purchase of the remaining moors, for
      enclosed by this land, eastward, near the railway line, were a few acres
      belonging to Lepailleur, the miller, who had never done anything with
      them. And so Mathieu preferred to select what remained of the marshy
      plateau, adding, however, that he would enter into negotiations respecting
      the moorland later on, when the miller should have consented to sell his
      enclosure. He knew that, ever since his property had been increasing,
      Lepailleur had regarded him with the greatest jealousy and hatred, and he
      did not think it advisable to apply to him personally, certain as he felt
      that he would fail in his endeavor. Seguin, however, pretended that if he
      took up the matter he would know how to bring the miller to reason, and
      even secure the enclosure for next to nothing. And indeed, thinking that
      he might yet induce Mathieu to purchase all the remaining property, he
      determined to see Lepailleur and negotiate with him before even signing
      the deed which was to convey to Mathieu the selected marshland on the
      plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the outcome proved as Mathieu had foreseen. Lepailleur asked such a
      monstrous price for his few acres enclosed within the estate that nothing
      could be done. When he was approached on the subject by Seguin, he made
      little secret of the rage he felt at Mathieu&rsquo;s triumph. He had told the
      young man that he would never succeed in reaping an ear of wheat from that
      uncultivated expanse, given over to brambles for centuries past; and yet
      now it was covered with abundant crops! And this had increased the
      miller&rsquo;s rancor against the soil; he hated it yet more than ever for its
      harshness to him, a peasant&rsquo;s son, and its kindliness towards that
      bourgeois, who seemed to have fallen from heaven expressly to
      revolutionize the region. Thus, in answer to Seguin, he declared with a
      sneer that since sorcerers had sprung up who were able to make wheat
      sprout from stones, his patch of ground was now worth its weight in gold.
      Several years previously, no doubt, he had offered Seguin the enclosure
      for a trifle; but times had changed, and he now crowed loudly over the
      other&rsquo;s folly in not entertaining his previous offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there seemed little likelihood of his turning the
      enclosure to account himself, for he was more disgusted than ever with the
      tilling of the soil. His disposition had been further embittered by the
      birth of a daughter, whom he would willingly have dispensed with, anxious
      as he was with respect to his son Antonin, now a lad of twelve, who proved
      so sharp and quick at school that he was regarded by the folks of Janville
      as a little prodigy. Mathieu had mortally offended the father and mother
      by suggesting that Antonin should be sent to an agricultural college&mdash;a
      very sensible suggestion, but one which exasperated them, determined as
      they were to make him a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lepailleur would not part with his enclosure on any reasonable terms,
      Seguin had to content himself for the time with selling Mathieu the
      selected marshland on the plateau. A deed of conveyance having been
      prepared, they exchanged signatures. And then, on Seguin&rsquo;s hands, there
      still remained nearly two hundred and fifty acres of woods in the
      direction of Lillebonne, together with the moorlands stretching to
      Vieux-Bourg, in which Lepailleur&rsquo;s few acres were enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the occasion of the visits which he paid Seguin in reference to
      these matters that Mathieu became acquainted with the terrible break-up of
      the other&rsquo;s home. The very rooms of the house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin,
      particularly the once sumptuous &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; spoke of neglect and
      abandonment. The desire to cut a figure in society, and to carry the &ldquo;fad&rdquo;
       of the moment to extremes, ever possessed Seguin; and thus he had for a
      while renounced his pretended artistic tastes for certain new forms of
      sport&mdash;the motor-car craze, and so forth. But his only real passion
      was horseflesh, and to this he at last returned. A racing stable which he
      set up quickly helped on his ruin. Women and gaming had been responsible
      for the loss of part of his large fortune, and now horses were devouring
      the remainder. It was said, too, that he gambled at the bourse, in the
      hope of recouping himself for his losses on the turf, and by way, too, of
      affecting an air of power and influence, for he allowed it to be supposed
      that he obtained information direct from members of the Government. And as
      his losses increased and downfall threatened him, all that remained of the
      <i>bel esprit</i> and moralist, once so prone to discuss literature and
      social philosophy with Santerre, was an embittered, impotent individual&mdash;one
      who had proclaimed himself a pessimist for fashion&rsquo;s sake, and was now
      caught in his own trap; having so spoilt his existence that he was now but
      an artisan of corruption and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was disaster in his home. Celeste the maid had long since been
      dismissed, and the children were now in the charge of a certain German
      governess called Nora, who virtually ruled the house. Her position with
      respect to Seguin was evident to one and all; but then, what of Seguin&rsquo;s
      wife and Santerre? The worst was, that this horrible life, which seemed to
      be accepted on either side, was known to the children, or, at all events,
      to the elder daughter Lucie, yet scarcely in her teens. There had been
      terrible scenes with this child, who evinced a mystical disposition, and
      was ever talking of becoming a nun when she grew up. Gaston, her brother,
      resembled his father; he was brutal in his ways, narrow-minded, supremely
      egotistical. Very different was the little girl Andree, whom La Catiche
      had suckled. She had become a pretty child&mdash;so affectionate, docile,
      and gay, that she scarcely complained even of her brother&rsquo;s teasing,
      almost bullying ways. &ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; thought Mathieu, &ldquo;that so lovable a
      child should have to grow up amid such surroundings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then his thoughts turned to his own home&mdash;to Chantebled. The
      debts contracted at the outset of his enterprise had at last been paid,
      and he alone was now the master there, resolved to have no other partners
      than his wife and children. It was for each of his children that he
      conquered a fresh expanse of land. That estate would remain their home,
      their source of nourishment, the tie linking them together, even if they
      became dispersed through the world in a variety of social positions. And
      thus how decisive was that growth of the property, the acquisition of that
      last lot of marshland which allowed the whole plateau to be cultivated!
      There might now come yet another child, for there would be food for him;
      wheat would grow to provide him with daily bread. And when the work was
      finished, when the last springs were captured, and the land had been
      drained and cleared, how prodigious was the scene at springtide!&mdash;with
      the whole expanse, as far as eye could see, one mass of greenery, full of
      the promise of harvest. Therein was compensation for every tear, every
      worry and anxiety of the earlier days of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mathieu, amid his creative work, received Marianne&rsquo;s gay and
      courageous assistance. And she was not merely a skilful helpmate, taking a
      share in the general management, keeping the accounts, and watching over
      the home. She remained both a loving and well-loved spouse, and a mother
      who nursed, reared, and educated her little ones in order to give them
      some of her own sense and heart. As Boutan remarked, it is not enough for
      a woman to have a child; she should also possess healthy moral gifts in
      order that she may bring it up in creditable fashion. Marianne, for her
      part, made it her pride to obtain everything from her children by dint of
      gentleness and grace. She was listened to, obeyed, and worshipped by them,
      because she was so beautiful, so kind, and so greatly beloved. Her task
      was scarcely easy, since she had eight children already; but in all things
      she proceeded in a very orderly fashion, utilizing the elder to watch over
      the younger ones, giving each a little share of loving authority, and
      extricating herself from every embarrassment by setting truth and justice
      above one and all. Blaise and Denis, the twins, who were now sixteen, and
      Ambroise, who was nearly fourteen, did in a measure escape her authority,
      being largely in their father&rsquo;s hands. But around her she had the five
      others&mdash;from Rose, who was eleven, to Louise, who was two years old;
      between them, at intervals of a couple of years, coming Gervais, Claire,
      and Gregoire. And each time that one flew away, as it were, feeling his
      wings strong enough for flight, there appeared another to nestle beside
      her. And it was again a daughter, Madeleine, who came at the expiration of
      those two years. And when Mathieu saw his wife erect and smiling again,
      with the dear little girl at her breast, he embraced her passionately and
      triumphed once again over every sorrow and every pang. Yet another child,
      yet more wealth and power, yet an additional force born into the world,
      another field ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas ever the great work, the good work, the work of fruitfulness
      spreading, thanks to the earth and thanks to woman, both victorious over
      destruction, offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child
      was born, and loving, willing, battling, toiling even amid suffering, and
      ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope.

    </h2>
    <p>
      TWO more years went by, and during those two years Mathieu and Marianne
      had yet another daughter; and this time, as the family increased,
      Chantebled also was increased by all the woodland extending eastward of
      the plateau to the distant farms of Mareuil and Lillebonne. All the
      northern part of the property was thus acquired: more than five hundred
      acres of woods, intersected by clearings which roads soon connected
      together. And those clearings, transformed into pasture-land, watered by
      the neighboring springs, enabled Mathieu to treble his live-stock and
      attempt cattle-raising on a large scale. It was the resistless conquest of
      life, it was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight, it was labor ever
      incessantly pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and suffering,
      making good all losses, and at each succeeding hour setting more energy,
      more health, and more joy in the veins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Froments had become conquerors, busily founding a little kingdom
      and building up a substantial fortune in land, the Beauchenes no longer
      derided them respecting what they had once deemed their extravagant idea
      in establishing themselves in the country. Astonished and anticipating now
      the fullest success, they treated them as well-to-do relatives, and
      occasionally visited them, delighted with the aspect of that big, bustling
      farm, so full of life and prosperity. It was in the course of these visits
      that Constance renewed her intercourse with her former schoolfellow,
      Madame Angelin, the Froments&rsquo; neighbor. A great change had come over the
      Angelins; they had ended by purchasing a little house at the end of the
      village, where they invariably spent the summer, but their buoyant
      happiness seemed to have departed. They had long desired to remain
      unburdened by children, and now they eagerly longed to have a child, and
      none came, though Claire, the wife, was as yet but six-and-thirty. Her
      husband, the once gay, handsome musketeer, was already turning gray and
      losing his eyesight&mdash;to such a degree, indeed, that he could scarcely
      see well enough to continue his profession as a fan-painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Angelin went to Paris she often called on Constance, to whom,
      before long, she confided all her worries. She had been in a doctor&rsquo;s
      hands for three years, but all to no avail, and now during the last six
      months she had been consulting a person in the Rue de Miromesnil, a
      certain Madame Bourdieu, said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance at first made light of her friend&rsquo;s statements, and in part
      declined to believe her. But when she found herself alone she felt
      disquieted by what she had heard. Perhaps she would have treated the
      matter as mere idle tittle-tattle, if she had not already regretted that
      she herself had no second child. On the day when the unhappy Morange had
      lost his only daughter, and had remained stricken down, utterly alone in
      life, she had experienced a vague feeling of anguish. Since that supreme
      loss the wretched accountant had been living on in a state of imbecile
      stupefaction, simply discharging his duties in a mechanical sort of way
      from force of habit. Scarcely speaking, but showing great gentleness of
      manner, he lived as one who was stranded, fated to remain forever at
      Beauchene&rsquo;s works, where his salary had now risen to eight thousand francs
      a year. It was not known what he did with this amount, which was
      considerable for a man who led such a narrow regular life, free from
      expenses and fancies outside his home&mdash;that flat which was much too
      big for him, but which he had, nevertheless, obstinately retained,
      shutting himself up therein, and leading a most misanthropic life in
      fierce solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his grievous prostration which had at one moment quite upset and
      affected Constance, so that she had even sobbed with the desolate man&mdash;she
      whose tears flowed so seldom! No doubt a thought that she might have had
      other children than Maurice came back to her in certain bitter hours of
      unconscious self-examination, when from the depths of her being, in which
      feelings of motherliness awakened, there rose vague fear, sudden dread,
      such as she had never known before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Maurice, her son, after a delicate youth which had necessitated great
      care, was now a handsome fellow of nineteen, still somewhat pale, but
      vigorous in appearance. He had completed his studies in a fairly
      satisfactory manner, and was already helping his father in the management
      of the works. And his adoring mother had never set higher hopes upon his
      head. She already pictured him as the master of that great establishment,
      whose prosperity he would yet increase, thereby rising to royal wealth and
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance&rsquo;s worship for that only son, to-morrow&rsquo;s hero; increased the
      more since his father day by day declined in her estimation, till she
      regarded him in fact with naught but contempt and disgust. It was a
      logical downfall, which she could not stop, and the successive phases of
      which she herself fatally precipitated. At the outset she had overlooked
      his infidelity; then from a spirit of duty and to save him from
      irreparable folly she had sought to retain him near her; and finally,
      failing in her endeavor, she had begun to feel loathing and disgust. He
      was now two-and-forty, he drank too much, he ate too much, he smoked too
      much. He was growing corpulent and scant of breath, with hanging lips and
      heavy eyelids; he no longer took care of his person as formerly, but went
      about slipshod, and indulged in the coarsest pleasantries. But it was more
      particularly away from his home that he sank into degradation, indulging
      in the low debauchery which had ever attracted him. Every now and again he
      disappeared from the house and slept elsewhere; then he concocted such
      ridiculous falsehoods that he could not be believed, or else did not take
      the trouble to lie at all. Constance, who felt powerless to influence him,
      ended by allowing him complete freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst was, that the dissolute life he led grievously affected the
      business. He who had been such a great and energetic worker had lost both
      mental and bodily vigor; he could no longer plan remunerative strokes of
      business; he no longer had the strength to undertake important contracts.
      He lingered in bed in the morning, and remained for three or four days
      without once going round the works, letting disorder and waste accumulate
      there, so that his once triumphal stock-takings now year by year showed a
      falling-off. And what an end it was for that egotist, that enjoyer, so
      gayly and noisily active, who had always professed that money&mdash;capital
      increased tenfold by the labor of others&mdash;was the only desirable
      source of power, and whom excess of money and excess of enjoyment now cast
      with appropriate irony to slow ruin, the final paralysis of the impotent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a supreme blow was to fall on Constance and fill her with horror of
      her husband. Some anonymous letters, the low, treacherous revenge of a
      dismissed servant, apprised her of Beauchene&rsquo;s former intrigue with
      Norine, that work-girl who had given birth to a boy, spirited away none
      knew whither. Though ten years had elapsed since that occurrence,
      Constance could not think of it without a feeling of revolt. Whither had
      that child been sent? Was he still alive? What ignominious existence was
      he leading? She was vaguely jealous of the boy. The thought that her
      husband had two sons and she but one was painful to her, now that all her
      motherly nature was aroused. But she devoted herself yet more ardently to
      her fondly loved Maurice; she made a demi-god of him, and for his sake
      even sacrificed her just rancor. She indeed came to the conclusion that he
      must not suffer from his father&rsquo;s indignity, and so it was for him that,
      with extraordinary strength of will, she ever preserved a proud demeanor,
      feigning that she was ignorant of everything, never addressing a reproach
      to her husband, but remaining, in the presence of others, the same
      respectful wife as formerly. And even when they were alone together she
      kept silence and avoided explanations and quarrels. Never even thinking of
      the possibility of revenge, she seemed, in the presence of her husband&rsquo;s
      profligacy, to attach herself more firmly to her home, clinging to her
      son, and protected by him from thought of evil as much as by her own
      sternness of heart and principles. And thus sorely wounded, full of
      repugnance but hiding her contempt, she awaited the triumph of that son
      who would purify and save the house, feeling the greatest faith in his
      strength, and quite surprised and anxious whenever, all at once, without
      reasonable cause, a little quiver from the unknown brought her a chill,
      affecting her heart as with remorse for some long-past fault which she no
      longer remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      That little quiver came back while she listened to all that Madame Angelin
      confided to her. And at last she became quite interested in her friend&rsquo;s
      case, and offered to accompany her some day when she might be calling on
      Madame Bourdieu. In the end they arranged to meet one Thursday afternoon
      for the purpose of going together to the Rue de Miromesnil.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, that same Thursday, about two o&rsquo;clock, Mathieu, who had
      come to Paris to see about a threshing-machine at Beauchene&rsquo;s works, was
      quietly walking along the Rue La Boetie when he met Cecile Moineaud, who
      was carrying a little parcel carefully tied round with string. She was now
      nearly twenty-one, but had remained slim, pale, and weak, since passing
      through the hands of Dr. Gaude. Mathieu had taken a great liking to her
      during the few months she had spent as a servant at Chantebled; and later,
      knowing what had befallen her at the hospital, he had regarded her with
      deep compassion. He had busied himself to find her easy work, and a friend
      of his had given her some cardboard boxes to paste together, the only
      employment that did not tire her thin weak hands. So childish had she
      remained that one would have taken her for a young girl suddenly arrested
      in her growth. Yet her slender fingers were skilful, and she contrived to
      earn some two francs a day in making the little boxes. And as she suffered
      greatly at her parents&rsquo; home, tortured by her brutal surroundings there,
      and robbed of her earnings week by week, her dream was to secure a home of
      her own, to find a little money that would enable her to install herself
      in a room where she might live in peace and quietness. It had occurred to
      Mathieu to give her a pleasant surprise some day by supplying her with the
      small sum she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you running so fast?&rdquo; he gayly asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting seemed to take her aback, and she answered in an evasive,
      embarrassed way: &ldquo;I am going to the Rue de Miromesnil for a call I have to
      make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noticing his kindly air, however, she soon told him the truth. Her sister,
      that poor creature Norine, had just given birth to another child, her
      third, at Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s establishment. A gentleman who had been
      protecting her had cast her adrift, and she had been obliged to sell her
      few sticks of furniture in order to get together a couple of hundred
      francs, and thus secure admittance to Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s house, for the
      mere idea of having to go to a hospital terrified her. Whenever she might
      be able to get about again, however, she would find herself in the
      streets, with the task of beginning life anew at one-and-thirty years of
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never behaved unkindly to me,&rdquo; resumed Cecile. &ldquo;I pity her with all
      my heart, and I have been to see her. I am taking her a little chocolate
      now. Ah! if you only saw her little boy! he is a perfect love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl&rsquo;s eyes shone, and her thin, pale face became radiant with a
      smile. The instinct of maternity remained keen within her, though she
      could never be a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity it is,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that Norine is so obstinately
      determined on getting rid of the baby, just as she got rid of the others.
      This little fellow, it&rsquo;s true, cries so much that she has had to give him
      the breast. But it&rsquo;s only for the time being; she says that she can&rsquo;t see
      him starve while he remains near her. But it quite upsets me to think that
      one can get rid of one&rsquo;s children; I had an idea of arranging things very
      differently. You know that I want to leave my parents, don&rsquo;t you? Well, I
      thought of renting a room and of taking my sister and her little boy with
      me. I would show Norine how to cut out and paste up those little boxes,
      and we might live, all three, happily together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t she consent?&rdquo; asked Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she told me that I was mad; and there&rsquo;s some truth in that, for I
      have no money even to rent a room. Ah! if you only knew how it distresses
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu concealed his emotion, and resumed in his quiet way: &ldquo;Well, there
      are rooms to be rented. And you would find a friend to help you. Only I am
      much afraid that you will never persuade your sister to keep her child,
      for I fancy that I know her ideas on that subject. A miracle would be
      needed to change them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick-witted as she was, Cecile darted a glance at him. The friend he
      spoke of was himself. Good heavens would her dream come true? She ended by
      bravely saying: &ldquo;Listen, monsieur; you are so kind that you really ought
      to do me a last favor. It would be to come with me and see Norine at once.
      You alone can talk to her and prevail on her perhaps. But let us walk
      slowly, for I am stifling, I feel so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, deeply touched, walked on beside her. They turned the corner of
      the Rue de Miromesnil, and his own heart began to beat as they climbed the
      stairs of Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s establishment. Ten years ago! Was it possible?
      He recalled everything that he had seen and heard in that house. And it
      all seemed to date from yesterday, for the building had not changed;
      indeed, he fancied that he could recognize the very grease-spots on the
      doors on the various landings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Cecile to Norine&rsquo;s room, he found Norine up and dressed, but
      seated at the side of her bed and nursing her babe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it you, monsieur?&rdquo; she exclaimed, as soon as she recognized her
      visitor. &ldquo;It is very kind of Cecile to have brought you. Ah! <i>mon Dieu</i>
      what a lot of things have happened since I last saw you! We are none of us
      any the younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scrutinized her, and she did indeed seem to him much aged. She was one
      of those blondes who fade rapidly after their thirtieth year. Still, if
      her face had become pasty and wore a weary expression, she remained
      pleasant-looking, and seemed as heedless, as careless as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecile wished to bring matters to the point at once. &ldquo;Here is your
      chocolate,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I met Monsieur Froment in the street, and he is so
      kind and takes so much interest in me that he is willing to help me in
      carrying out my idea of renting a room where you might live and work with
      me. So I begged him to come up here and talk with you, and prevail on you
      to keep that poor little fellow of yours. You see, I don&rsquo;t want to take
      you unawares; I warn you in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine started with emotion, and began to protest. &ldquo;What is all this
      again?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t want to be worried. I&rsquo;m too unhappy as
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu immediately intervened, and made her understand that if she
      reverted to the life she had been leading she would simply sink lower and
      lower. She herself had no illusions on that point; she spoke bitterly
      enough of her experiences. Her youth had flown, her good-looks were
      departing, and the prospect seemed hopeless enough. But then what could
      she do? When one had fallen into the mire one had to stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, ah! yes,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of that infernal life which
      some folks think so amusing. But it&rsquo;s like a stone round my neck; I can&rsquo;t
      get rid of it. I shall have to keep to it till I&rsquo;m picked up in some
      corner and carried off to die at a hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke these words with the fierce energy of one who all at once
      clearly perceives the fate which she cannot escape. Then she glanced at
      her infant, who was still nursing. &ldquo;He had better go his way and I&rsquo;ll go
      mine,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Then we shan&rsquo;t inconvenience one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time her voice softened, and an expression of infinite tenderness
      passed over her desolate face. And Mathieu, in astonishment, divining the
      new emotion that possessed her, though she did not express it, made haste
      to rejoin: &ldquo;To let him go his way would be the shortest way to kill him,
      now that you have begun to give him the breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it my fault?&rdquo; she angrily exclaimed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to give it to him;
      you know what my ideas were. And I flew into a passion and almost fought
      Madame Bourdieu when she put him in my arms. But then how could I hold
      out? He cried so dreadfully with hunger, poor little mite, and seemed to
      suffer so much, that I was weak enough to let him nurse just a little. I
      didn&rsquo;t intend to repeat it, but the next day he cried again, and so I had
      to continue, worse luck for me! There was no pity shown me; I&rsquo;ve been made
      a hundred times more unhappy than I should have been, for, of course, I
      shall soon have to get rid of him as I got rid of the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears appeared in her eyes. It was the oft-recurring story of the
      girl-mother who is prevailed upon to nurse her child for a few days, in
      the hope that she will grow attached to the babe and be unable to part
      from it. The chief object in view is to save the child, because its best
      nurse is its natural nurse, the mother. And Norine, instinctively divining
      the trap set for her, had struggled to escape it, and repeated, sensibly
      enough, that one ought not to begin such a task when one meant to throw it
      up in a few days&rsquo; time. As soon as she yielded she was certain to be
      caught; her egotism was bound to be vanquished by the wave of pity, love,
      and hope that would sweep through her heart. The poor, pale, puny infant
      had weighed but little the first time he took the breast. But every
      morning afterwards he had been weighed afresh, and on the wall at the foot
      of the bed had been hung the diagram indicating the daily difference of
      weight. At first Norine had taken little interest in the matter, but as
      the line gradually ascended, plainly indicating how much the child was
      profiting, she gave it more and more attention. All at once, as the result
      of an indisposition, the line had dipped down; and since then she had
      always feverishly awaited the weighing, eager to see if the line would
      once more ascend. Then, a continuous rise having set in, she laughed with
      delight. That little line, which ever ascended, told her that her child
      was saved, and that all the weight and strength he acquired was derived
      from her&mdash;from her milk, her blood, her flesh. She was completing the
      appointed work; and motherliness, at last awakened within her, was
      blossoming in a florescence of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to kill him,&rdquo; continued Mathieu, &ldquo;you need only take him from
      your breast. See how eagerly the poor little fellow is nursing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed true. And Norine burst into big sobs: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!
      you are beginning to torture me again. Do you think that I shall take any
      pleasure in getting rid of him now? You force me to say things which make
      me weep at night when I think of them. I shall feel as if my very vitals
      were being torn out when this child is taken from me! There, are you both
      pleased that you have made me say it? But what good does it do to put me
      in such a state, since nobody can remedy things, and he must needs go to
      the foundlings, while I return to the gutter, to wait for the broom that&rsquo;s
      to sweep me away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cecile, who likewise was weeping, kissed and kissed the child, and
      again reverted to her dream, explaining how happy they would be, all three
      of them, in a nice room, which she pictured full of endless joys, like
      some Paradise. It was by no means difficult to cut out and paste up the
      little boxes. As soon as Norine should know the work, she, who was strong,
      might perhaps earn three francs a day at it. And five francs a day between
      them, would not that mean fortune, the rearing of the child, and all evil
      things forgotten, at an end? Norine, more weary than ever, gave way at
      last, and ceased refusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You daze me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do as you like&mdash;but certainly
      it will be great happiness to keep this dear little fellow with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecile, enraptured, clapped her hands; while Mathieu, who was greatly
      moved, gave utterance to these deeply significant words: &ldquo;You have saved
      him, and now he saves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Norine at last smiled. She felt happy now; a great weight had been
      lifted from her heart. And carrying her child in her arms she insisted on
      accompanying her sister and their friend to the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last half-hour Constance and Madame Angelin had been deep in
      consultation with Madame Bourdieu. The former had not given her name, but
      had simply played the part of an obliging friend accompanying another on
      an occasion of some delicacy. Madame Bourdieu, with the keen scent
      characteristic of her profession, divined a possible customer in that
      inquisitive lady who put such strange questions to her. However, a rather
      painful scene took place, for realizing that she could not forever deceive
      Madame Angelin with false hopes, Madame Bourdieu decided to tell the truth&mdash;her
      case was hopeless. Constance, however, at last made a sign to entreat her
      to continue deceiving her friend, if only for charity&rsquo;s sake. The other,
      therefore, while conducting her visitors to the landing, spoke a few
      hopeful words to Madame Angelin: &ldquo;After all, dear madame,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;one
      must never despair. I did wrong to speak as I did just now. I may yet be
      mistaken. Come back to see me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mathieu and Cecile were still on the landing in
      conversation with Norine, whose infant had fallen asleep in her arms.
      Constance and Madame Angelin were so surprised at finding the farmer of
      Chantebled in the company of the two young women that they pretended they
      did not see him. All at once, however, Constance, with the help of memory,
      recognized Norine, the more readily perhaps as she was now aware that
      Mathieu had, ten years previously, acted as her husband&rsquo;s intermediary.
      And a feeling of revolt and the wildest fancies instantly arose within
      her. What was Mathieu doing in that house? whose child was it that the
      young woman carried in her arms? At that moment the other child seemed to
      peer forth from the past; she saw it in swaddling clothes, like the infant
      there; indeed, she almost confounded one with the other, and imagined that
      it was indeed her husband&rsquo;s illegitimate son that was sleeping in his
      mother&rsquo;s arms before her. Then all the satisfaction she had derived from
      what she had heard Madame Bourdieu say departed, and she went off furious
      and ashamed, as if soiled and threatened by all the vague abominations
      which she had for some time felt around her, without knowing, however,
      whence came the little chill which made her shudder as with dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mathieu, he saw that neither Norine nor Cecile had recognized
      Madame Beauchene under her veil, and so he quietly continued explaining to
      the former that he would take steps to secure for her from the Assistance
      Publique&mdash;the official organization for the relief of the poor&mdash;a
      cradle and a supply of baby linen, as well as immediate pecuniary succor,
      since she undertook to keep and nurse her child. Afterwards he would
      obtain for her an allowance of thirty francs a month for at least one
      year. This would greatly help the sisters, particularly in the earlier
      stages of their life together in the room which they had settled to rent.
      When Mathieu added that he would take upon himself the preliminary outlay
      of a little furniture and so forth, Norine insisted upon kissing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is with a good heart,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It does one good to meet a man
      like you. And come, kiss my poor little fellow, too; it will bring him
      good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the Rue La Boetie it occurred to Mathieu, who was bound for
      the Beauchene works, to take a cab and let Cecile alight near her parents&rsquo; 
      home, since it was in the neighborhood of the factory. But she explained
      to him that she wished, first of all, to call upon her sister Euphrasie in
      the Rue Caroline. This street was in the same direction, and so Mathieu
      made her get into the cab, telling her that he would set her down at her
      sister&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so amazed, so happy at seeing her dream at last on the point of
      realization, that as she sat in the cab by the side of Mathieu she did not
      know how to thank him. Her eyes were quite moist, all smiles and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think me a bad daughter, monsieur,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m
      so pleased to leave home. Papa still works as much as he is able, though
      he does not get much reward for it at the factory. And mamma does all she
      can at home, though she hasn&rsquo;t much strength left her nowadays. Since
      Victor came back from the army, he has married and has children of his
      own, and I&rsquo;m even afraid that he&rsquo;ll have more than he can provide for, as,
      while he was in the army, he seems to have lost all taste for work. But
      the sharpest of the family is that lazy-bones Irma, my younger sister,
      who&rsquo;s so pretty and so delicate-looking, perhaps because she&rsquo;s always ill.
      As you may remember, mamma used to fear that Irma might turn out badly
      like Norine. Well, not at all! Indeed, she&rsquo;s the only one of us who is
      likely to do well, for she&rsquo;s going to marry a clerk in the post-office.
      And so the only ones left at home are myself and Alfred. Oh! he is a
      perfect bandit! That is the plain truth. He committed a theft the other
      day, and one had no end of trouble to get him out of the hands of the
      police commissary. But all the same, mamma has a weakness for him, and
      lets him take all my earnings. Yes, indeed, I&rsquo;ve had quite enough of him,
      especially as he is always terrifying me out of my wits, threatening to
      beat and even kill me, though he well knows that ever since my illness the
      slightest noise throws me into a faint. And as, all considered, neither
      papa nor mamma needs me, it&rsquo;s quite excusable, isn&rsquo;t it, that I should
      prefer living quietly alone. It is my right, is it not, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on to speak of her sister Euphrasie, who had fallen into a most
      wretched condition, said she, ever since passing through Dr. Gaude&rsquo;s
      hands. Her home had virtually been broken up, she had become decrepit, a
      mere bundle of rags, unable even to handle a broom. It made one tremble to
      see her. Then, after a pause, just as the cab was reaching the Rue
      Caroline, the girl continued: &ldquo;Will you come up to see her? You might say
      a few kind words to her. It would please me, for I&rsquo;m going on a rather
      unpleasant errand. I thought that she would have strength enough to make
      some little boxes like me, and thus earn a few pence for herself; but she
      has kept the work I gave her more than a month now, and if she really
      cannot do it I must take it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu consented, and in the room upstairs he beheld one of the most
      frightful, poignant spectacles that he had ever witnessed. In the centre
      of that one room where the family slept and ate, Euphrasie sat on a
      straw-bottomed chair; and although she was barely thirty years of age, one
      might have taken her for a little old woman of fifty; so thin and so
      withered did she look that she resembled one of those fruits, suddenly
      deprived of sap, that dry up on the tree. Her teeth had fallen, and of her
      hair she only retained a few white locks. But the more characteristic mark
      of this mature senility was a wonderful loss of muscular strength, an
      almost complete disappearance of will, energy, and power of action, so
      that she now spent whole days, idle, stupefied, without courage even to
      raise a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cecile told her that her visitor was M. Froment, the former chief
      designer at the Beauchene works, she did not even seem to recognize him;
      she no longer took interest in anything. And when her sister spoke of the
      object of her visit, asking for the work with which she had entrusted her,
      she answered with a gesture of utter weariness: &ldquo;Oh! what can you expect!
      It takes me too long to stick all those little bits of cardboard together.
      I can&rsquo;t do it; it throws me into a perspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a stout woman, who was cutting some bread and butter for the three
      children, intervened with an air of quiet authority: &ldquo;You ought to take
      those materials away, Mademoiselle Cecile. She&rsquo;s incapable of doing
      anything with them. They will end by getting dirty, and then your people
      won&rsquo;t take them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This stout woman was a certain Madame Joseph, a widow of forty and a
      charwoman by calling, whom Benard, the husband, had at first engaged to
      come two hours every morning to attend to the housework, his wife not
      having strength enough to put on a child&rsquo;s shoes or to set a pot on the
      fire. At first Euphrasie had offered furious resistance to this intrusion
      of a stranger, but, her physical decline progressing, she had been obliged
      to yield. And then things had gone from bad to worse, till Madame Joseph
      became supreme in the household. Between times there had been terrible
      scenes over it all; but the wretched Euphrasie, stammering and shivering,
      had at last resigned herself to the position, like some little old woman
      sunk into second childhood and already cut off from the world. That Benard
      and Madame Joseph were not bad-hearted in reality was shown by the fact
      that although Euphrasie was now but an useless encumbrance, they kept her
      with them, instead of flinging her into the streets as others would have
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there you are again in the middle of the room!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed
      the fat woman, who each time that she went hither and thither found it
      necessary to avoid the other&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;How funny it is that you can never
      put yourself in a corner! Auguste will be coming in for his four o&rsquo;clock
      snack in a moment, and he won&rsquo;t be at all pleased if he doesn&rsquo;t find his
      cheese and his glass of wine on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, Euphrasie nervously staggered to her feet, and with the
      greatest trouble dragged her chair towards the table. Then she sat down
      again limp and very weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Madame Joseph was bringing the cheese, Benard, whose workshop was
      near by, made his appearance. He was still a full-bodied, jovial fellow,
      and began to jest with his sister-in-law while showing great politeness
      towards Mathieu, whom he thanked for taking interest in his unhappy wife&rsquo;s
      condition. &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t her fault; it
      is all due to those rascally doctors at the hospital. For a year or so one
      might have thought her cured, but you see what has now become of her. Ah!
      it ought not to be allowed! You are no doubt aware that they treated
      Cecile just the same. And there was another, too, a baroness, whom you
      must know. She called here the other day to see Euphrasie, and, upon my
      word, I didn&rsquo;t recognize her. She used to be such a fine woman, and now
      she looks a hundred years old. Yes, yes, I say that the doctors ought to
      be sent to prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to sit down to table when he stumbled against Euphrasie&rsquo;s
      chair. She sat watching him with an anxious, semi-stupefied expression.
      &ldquo;There you are, in my way as usual!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;one is always tumbling up
      against you. Come, make a little room, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to be a very terrible customer, but at the sound of his
      voice she began to tremble, full of childish fear, as if she were
      threatened with a thrashing. And this time she found strength enough to
      drag her chair as far as a dark closet, the door of which was open. She
      there sought refuge, ensconcing herself in the gloom, amid which one could
      vaguely espy her shrunken, wrinkled face, which suggested that of some
      very old great-grandmother, who was taking years and years to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu&rsquo;s heart contracted as he observed that senile terror, that
      shivering obedience on the part of a woman whose harsh, dry, aggressively
      quarrelsome disposition he so well remembered. Industrious, self-willed,
      full of life as she had once been, she was now but a limp human rag. And
      yet her case was recorded in medical annals as one of the renowned Gaude&rsquo;s
      great miracles of cure. Ah! how truly had Boutan spoken in saying that
      people ought to wait to see the real results of those victorious
      operations which were sapping the vitality of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecile, however, with eager affection, kissed the three children, who
      somehow continued to grow up in that wrecked household. Tears came to her
      eyes, and directly Madame Joseph had given her back the work-materials
      entrusted to Euphrasie she hurried Mathieu away. And, as they reached the
      street, she said: &ldquo;Thank you, Monsieur Froment; I can go home on foot now&mdash;.
      How frightful, eh? Ah! as I told you, we shall be in Paradise, Norine and
      I, in the quiet room which you have so kindly promised to rent for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Beauchene&rsquo;s establishment Mathieu immediately repaired to the
      workshops, but he could obtain no precise information respecting his
      threshing-machine, though he had ordered it several months previously. He
      was told that the master&rsquo;s son, Monsieur Maurice, had gone out on
      business, and that nobody could give him an answer, particularly as the
      master himself had not put in an appearance at the works that week. He
      learnt, however, that Beauchene had returned from a journey that very day,
      and must be indoors with his wife. Accordingly, he resolved to call at the
      house, less on account of the threshing-machine than to decide a matter of
      great interest to him, that of the entry of one of his twin sons, Blaise,
      into the establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This big fellow had lately left college, and although he had only
      completed his nineteenth year, he was on the point of marrying a
      portionless young girl, Charlotte Desvignes, for whom he had conceived a
      romantic attachment ever since childhood. His parents, seeing in this
      match a renewal of their own former loving improvidence, had felt moved,
      and unwilling to drive the lad to despair. But, if he was to marry, some
      employment must first be found for him. Fortunately this could be managed.
      While Denis, the other of the twins, entered a technical school,
      Beauchene, by way of showing his esteem for the increasing fortune of his
      good cousins, as he now called the Froments, cordially offered to give
      Blaise a situation at his establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being ushered into Constance&rsquo;s little yellow salon, Mathieu found her
      taking a cup of tea with Madame Angelin, who had come back with her from
      the Rue de Miromesnil. Beauchene&rsquo;s unexpected arrival on the scene had
      disagreeably interrupted their private converse. He had returned from one
      of the debauches in which he so frequently indulged under the pretext of
      making a short business journey, and, still slightly intoxicated, with
      feverish, sunken eyes and clammy tongue, he was wearying the two women
      with his impudent, noisy falsehoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear fellow!&rdquo; he exclaimed on seeing Mathieu, &ldquo;I was just telling
      the ladies of my return from Amiens&mdash;. What wonderful duck pates they
      have there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on Mathieu speaking to him of Blaise, he launched out into
      protestations of friendship. It was understood, the young fellow need only
      present himself at the works, and in the first instance he should be put
      with Morange, in order that he might learn something of the business
      mechanism of the establishment. Thus talking, Beauchene puffed and coughed
      and spat, exhaling meantime the odor of tobacco, alcohol, and musk, which
      he always brought back from his &ldquo;sprees,&rdquo; while his wife smiled
      affectionately before the others as was her wont, but directed at him
      glances full of despair and disgust whenever Madame Angelin turned her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Beauchene continued talking too much, owning for instance that he did
      not know how far the thresher might be from completion, Mathieu noticed
      Constance listening anxiously. The idea of Blaise entering the
      establishment had already rendered her grave, and now her husband&rsquo;s
      apparent ignorance of important business matters distressed her. Besides,
      the thought of Norine was reviving in her mind; she remembered the girl&rsquo;s
      child, and almost feared some fresh understanding between Beauchene and
      Mathieu. All at once, however, she gave a cry of great relief: &ldquo;Ah! here
      is Maurice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her son was entering the room&mdash;her son, the one and only god on whom
      she now set her affection and pride, the crown-prince who to-morrow would
      become king, who would save the kingdom from perdition, and who would
      exalt her on his right hand in a blaze of glory. She deemed him handsome,
      tall, strong, and as invincible in his nineteenth year as all the knights
      of the old legends. When he explained that he had just profitably
      compromised a worrying transaction in which his father had rashly
      embarked, she pictured him repairing disasters and achieving victories.
      And she triumphed more than ever on hearing him promise that the
      threshing-machine should be ready before the end of that same week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take a cup of tea, my dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It would do you
      good; you worry your mind too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maurice accepted the offer, and gayly replied: &ldquo;Oh! do you know, an
      omnibus almost crushed me just now in the Rue de Rivoli!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this his mother turned livid, and the cup which she held escaped from
      her hand. Ah! God, was her happiness at the mercy of an accident? Then
      once again the fearful threat sped by, that icy gust which came she knew
      not whence, but which ever chilled her to her bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you stupid,&rdquo; said Beauchene, laughing, &ldquo;it was he who crushed the
      omnibus, since here he is, telling you the tale. Ah! my poor Maurice, your
      mother is really ridiculous. I know how strong you are, and I&rsquo;m quite at
      ease about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day Madame Angelin returned to Janville with Mathieu. They found
      themselves alone in the railway carriage, and all at once, without any
      apparent cause, tears started from the young woman&rsquo;s eyes. At this she
      apologized, and murmured as if in a dream: &ldquo;To have a child, to rear him,
      and then lose him&mdash;ah! certainly one&rsquo;s grief must then be poignant.
      Yet one has had him with one; he has grown up, and one has known for years
      all the joy of having him at one&rsquo;s side. But when one never has a child&mdash;never,
      never&mdash;ah! come rather suffering and mourning than such a void as
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And meantime, at Chantebled, Mathieu and Marianne founded, created,
      increased, and multiplied, again proving victorious in the eternal battle
      which life wages against death, thanks to that continual increase both of
      offspring and of fertile land, which was like their very existence, their
      joy and their strength. Desire passed like a gust of flame, desire divine
      and fruitful, since they possessed the power of love, of kindliness, and
      health. And their energy did the rest&mdash;that will of action, that
      quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that is necessary, the labor
      that has made and that regulates the world. Yet even during those two
      years it was not without constant struggling that they achieved victory.
      True, victory was becoming more and more certain as the estate expanded.
      The petty worries of earlier days had disappeared, and the chief question
      was now one of ruling sensibly and equitably. All the land had been
      purchased northward on the plateau, from the farm of Mareuil to the farm
      of Lillebonne; there was not a copse that did not belong to the Froments,
      and thus beside the surging sea of corn there rose a royal park of
      centenarian trees. Apart from the question of felling portions of the wood
      for timber, Mathieu was not disposed to retain the remainder for mere
      beauty&rsquo;s sake; and accordingly avenues were devised connecting the broad
      clearings, and cattle were then turned into this part of the property. The
      ark of life, increased by hundreds of animals, expanded, burst through the
      great trees. There was a fresh growth of fruitfulness: more and more
      cattle-sheds had to be built, sheepcotes had to be created, and manure
      came in loads and loads to endow the land with wondrous fertility. And now
      yet other children might come, for floods of milk poured forth, and there
      were herds and flocks to clothe and nourish them. Beside the ripening
      crops the woods waved their greenery, quivering with the eternal seeds
      that germinated in their shade, under the dazzling sun. And only one more
      stretch of land, the sandy slopes on the east, remained to be conquered in
      order that the kingdom might be complete. Assuredly this compensated one
      for all former tears, for all the bitter anxiety of the first years of
      toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while Mathieu completed his conquest, there came to Marianne during
      those two years the joy of marrying one of her children even while she was
      again <i>enceinte</i>, for, like our good mother the earth, she also
      remained fruitful. &lsquo;Twas a delightful fete, full of infinite hope, that
      wedding of Blaise and Charlotte; he a strong young fellow of nineteen, she
      an adorable girl of eighteen summers, each loving the other with a love of
      nosegay freshness that had budded, even in childhood&rsquo;s hour, along the
      flowery paths of Chantebled. The eight other children were all there:
      first the big brothers, Denis, Ambroise, and Gervais, who were now
      finishing their studies; next Rose, the eldest girl, now fourteen, who
      promised to become a woman of healthy beauty and happy gayety of
      disposition; then Claire, who was still a child, and Gregoire, who was
      only just going to college; without counting the very little ones, Louise
      and Madeleine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folks came out of curiosity from the surrounding villages to see the gay
      troop conduct their big brother to the municipal offices. It was a
      marvellous cortege, flowery like springtide, full of felicity, which moved
      every heart. Often, moreover, on ordinary holidays, when for the sake of
      an outing the family repaired in a band to some village market, there was
      such a gallop in traps, on horseback, and on bicycles, while the girls&rsquo; 
      hair streamed in the wind and loud laughter rang out from one and all,
      that people would stop to watch the charming cavalcade. &ldquo;Here are the
      troops passing!&rdquo; folks would jestingly exclaim, implying that nothing
      could resist those Froments, that the whole countryside was theirs by
      right of conquest, since every two years their number increased. And this
      time, at the expiration of those last two years it was again to a
      daughter, Marguerite, that Marianne gave birth. For a while she remained
      in a feverish condition, and there were fears, too, that she might be
      unable to nurse her infant as she had done all the others. Thus, when
      Mathieu saw her erect once more and smiling, with her dear little
      Marguerite at her breast, he embraced her passionately, and triumphed once
      again over every sorrow and every pang. Yet another child, yet more wealth
      and power, yet an additional force born into the world, another field
      ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s harvest!
    </p>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas ever the great work, the good work, the work of fruitfulness
      spreading, thanks to the earth and thanks to woman, both victorious over
      destruction, offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child
      was born, and loving, willing, battling, toiling, even amid suffering, and
      ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope.

    </h2>
    <p>
      TWO more years went by, and during those two years yet another child, this
      time a boy, was born to Mathieu and Marianne. And on this occasion, at the
      same time as the family increased, the estate of Chantebled was increased
      also by all the heatherland extending to the east as far as the village of
      Vieux-Bourg. And this time the last lot was purchased, the conquest of the
      estate was complete. The 1250 acres of uncultivated soil which Seguin&rsquo;s
      father, the old army contractor, had formerly purchased in view of
      erecting a palatial residence there were now, thanks to unremitting
      effort, becoming fruitful from end to end. The enclosure belonging to the
      Lepailleurs, who stubbornly refused to sell it, alone set a strip of dry,
      stony, desolate land amid the broad green plain. And it was all life&rsquo;s
      resistless conquest; it was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight; it was
      labor ever incessantly pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and
      suffering, making good all losses, and at each succeeding hour setting
      more energy, more health, and more joy in the veins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise, now the father of a little girl some ten months old, had been
      residing at the Beauchene works since the previous winter. He occupied the
      little pavilion where his mother had long previously given birth to his
      brother Gervais. His wife Charlotte had conquered the Beauchenes by her
      fair grace, her charming, bouquet-like freshness, to such a point, indeed,
      that even Constance had desired to have her near her. The truth was that
      Madame Desvignes had made adorable creatures of her two daughters,
      Charlotte and Marthe. At the death of her husband, a stockbroker&rsquo;s
      confidential clerk, who had died, leaving her at thirty years of age in
      very indifferent circumstances, she had gathered her scanty means together
      and withdrawn to Janville, her native place, where she had entirely
      devoted herself to her daughters&rsquo; education. Knowing that they would be
      almost portionless, she had brought them up extremely well, in the hope
      that this might help to find them husbands, and it so chanced that she
      proved successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affectionate intercourse sprang up between her and the Froments; the
      children played together; and it was, indeed, from those first games that
      came the love-romance which was to end in the marriage of Blaise and
      Charlotte. By the time the latter reached her eighteenth birthday and
      married, Marthe her sister, then fourteen years old, had become the
      inseparable companion of Rose Froment, who was of the same age and as
      pretty as herself, though dark instead of fair. Charlotte, who had a more
      delicate, and perhaps a weaker, nature than her gay, sensible sister, had
      become passionately fond of drawing and painting, which she had learnt at
      first simply by way of accomplishment. She had ended, however, by painting
      miniatures very prettily, and, as her mother remarked, her proficiency
      might prove a resource to her in the event of misfortune. Certainly there
      was some of the bourgeois respect and esteem for a good education in the
      fairly cordial greeting which Constance extended to Charlotte, who had
      painted a miniature portrait of her, a good though a flattering likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Blaise, who was endowed with the creative fire of the
      Froments, ever striving, ever hard at work, became a valuable assistant to
      Maurice as soon as a brief stay in Morange&rsquo;s office had made him familiar
      with the business of the firm. Indeed it was Maurice who, finding that his
      father seconded him less and less, had insisted on Blaise and Charlotte
      installing themselves in the little pavilion, in order that the former&rsquo;s
      services might at all times be available. And Constance, ever on her knees
      before her son, could in this matter only obey respectfully. She evinced
      boundless faith in the vastness of Maurice&rsquo;s intellect. His studies had
      proved fairly satisfactory; if he was somewhat slow and heavy, and had
      frequently been delayed by youthful illnesses, he had, nevertheless,
      diligently plodded on. As he was far from talkative, his mother gave out
      that he was a reflective, concentrated genius, who would astonish the
      world by actions, not by speech. Before he was even fifteen she said of
      him, in her adoring way: &ldquo;Oh! he has a great mind.&rdquo; And, naturally enough,
      she only acknowledged Blaise to be a necessary lieutenant, a humble
      assistant, one whose hand would execute the sapient young master&rsquo;s orders.
      The latter, to her thinking, was now so strong and so handsome, and he was
      so quickly reviving the business compromised by the father&rsquo;s slow
      collapse, that surely he must be on the high-road to prodigious wealth, to
      that final great triumph, indeed, of which she had been dreaming so
      proudly, so egotistically, for so many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all at once the thunderbolt fell. It was not without some hesitation
      that Blaise had agreed to make the little pavilion his home, for he knew
      that there was an idea of reducing him to the status of a mere piece of
      machinery. But at the birth of his little girl he bravely decided to
      accept the proposal, and to engage in the battle of life even as his
      father had engaged in it, mindful of the fact that he also might in time
      have a large family. But it so happened that one morning, when he went up
      to the house to ask Maurice for some instructions, he heard from Constance
      herself that the young man had spent a very bad night, and that she had
      therefore prevailed on him to remain in bed. She did not evince any great
      anxiety on the subject; the indisposition could only be due to a little
      fatigue. Indeed, for a week past the two cousins had been tiring
      themselves out over the delivery of a very important order, which had set
      the entire works in motion. Besides, on the previous day Maurice,
      bareheaded and in perspiration, had imprudently lingered in a draught in
      one of the sheds while a machine was being tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening he was seized with intense fever, and Boutan was hastily
      summoned. On the morrow, alarmed, though he scarcely dared to say it, by
      the lightning-like progress of the illness, the doctor insisted on a
      consultation, and two of his colleagues being summoned, they soon agreed
      together. The malady was an extremely infectious form of galloping
      consumption, the more violent since it had found in the patient a field
      where there was little to resist its onslaught. Beauchene was away from
      home, travelling as usual. Constance, for her part, in spite of the grave
      mien of the doctors, who could not bring themselves to tell her the brutal
      truth, remained, in spite of growing anxiety, full of a stubborn hope that
      her son, the hero, the demi-god necessary for her own life, could not be
      seriously ill and likely to die. But only three days elapsed, and during
      the very night that Beauchene returned home, summoned by a telegram, the
      young fellow expired in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality his death was simply the final decomposition of impoverished,
      tainted, bourgeois blood, the sudden disappearance of a poor, mediocre
      being who, despite a facade of seeming health, had been ailing since
      childhood. But what an overwhelming blow it was both for the mother and
      for the father, all whose dreams and calculations it swept away! The only
      son, the one and only heir, the prince of industry, whom they had desired
      with such obstinate, scheming egotism, had passed away like a shadow;
      their arms clasped but a void, and the frightful reality arose before
      them; a moment had sufficed, and they were childless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise was with the parents at the bedside at the moment when Maurice
      expired. It was then about two in the morning, and as soon as possible he
      telegraphed the news of the death to Chantebled. Nine o&rsquo;clock was striking
      when Marianne, very pale, quite upset, came into the yard to call Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maurice is dead!... <i>Mon Dieu</i>! an only son; poor people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood there thunderstruck, chilled and trembling. They had simply
      heard that the young man was poorly; they had not imagined him to be
      seriously ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go to dress,&rdquo; said Mathieu; &ldquo;I shall take the quarter-past ten
      o&rsquo;clock train. I must go to kiss them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although Marianne was expecting her eleventh child before long, she
      decided to accompany her husband. It would have pained her to be unable to
      give this proof of affection to her cousins, who, all things considered,
      had treated Blaise and his young wife very kindly. Moreover, she was
      really grieved by the terrible catastrophe. So she and her husband, after
      distributing the day&rsquo;s work among the servants, set out for Janville
      station, which they reached just in time to catch the quarter-past ten
      o&rsquo;clock train. It was already rolling on again when they recognized the
      Lepailleurs and their son Antonin in the very compartment where they were
      seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the Froments thus together in full dress, the miller imagined that
      they were going to a wedding, and when he learnt that they had a visit of
      condolence to make, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! so it&rsquo;s just the contrary. But no
      matter, it&rsquo;s an outing, a little diversion nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Mathieu&rsquo;s victory, since the whole of the estate of Chantebled had
      been conquered and fertilized, Lepailleur had shown some respect for his
      bourgeois rival. Nevertheless, although he could not deny the results
      hitherto obtained, he did not altogether surrender, but continued
      sneering, as if he expected that some rending of heaven or earth would
      take place to prove him in the right. He would not confess that he had
      made a mistake; he repeated that he knew the truth, and that folks would
      some day see plainly enough that a peasant&rsquo;s calling was the very worst
      calling there could be, since the dirty land had gone bankrupt and would
      yield nothing more. Besides, he held his revenge&mdash;that enclosure
      which he left barren, uncultivated, by way of protest against the
      adjoining estate which it intersected. The thought of this made him
      ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed in his ridiculously vain, scoffing way, &ldquo;we are going
      to Paris too. Yes, we are going to install this young gentleman there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed as he spoke to his son Antonin, now a tall, carroty fellow of
      eighteen, with an elongated head. A few light-colored bristles were
      already sprouting on his chin and cheeks, and he wore town attire, with a
      silk hat and gloves, and a bright blue necktie. After astonishing Janville
      by his success at school, he had displayed so much repugnance to manual
      work that his father had decided to make &ldquo;a Parisian&rdquo; of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is decided; you have quite made up your mind?&rdquo; asked Mathieu in a
      friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; why should I force him to toil and moil without the least hope
      of ever enriching himself? Neither my father nor I ever managed to put a
      copper by with that wretched old mill of ours. Why, the mill-stones wear
      away with rot more than with grinding corn. And the wretched fields, too,
      yield far more pebbles than crowns. And so, as he&rsquo;s now a scholar, he may
      as well try his fortune in Paris. There&rsquo;s nothing like city life to
      sharpen a man&rsquo;s wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lepailleur, who never took her eyes from her son, but remained in
      admiration before him as formerly before her husband, now exclaimed with
      an air of rapture: &ldquo;Yes, yes, he has a place as a clerk with Maitre
      Rousselet, the attorney. We have rented a little room for him; I have seen
      about the furniture and the linen, and to-day&rsquo;s the great day; he will
      sleep there to-night, after we have dined, all three, at a good
      restaurant. Ah! yes, I&rsquo;m very pleased; he&rsquo;s making a start now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will perhaps end by being a minister of state,&rdquo; said Mathieu, with
      a smile; &ldquo;who knows? Everything is possible nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It all typified the exodus from the country districts towards the towns,
      the feverish impatience to make a fortune, which was becoming general.
      Even the parents nowadays celebrated their child&rsquo;s departure, and
      accompanied the adventurer on his way, anxious and proud to climb the
      social ladder with him. And that which brought a smile to the lips of the
      farmer of Chantebled, the bourgeois who had become a peasant, was the
      thought of the double change: the miller&rsquo;s son going to Paris, whereas he
      had gone to the earth, the mother of all strength and regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonin, however, had also begun to laugh with the air of an artful idler
      who was more particularly attracted by the free dissipation of Paris life.
      &ldquo;Oh! minister?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much taste for that. I would much
      sooner win a million at once so as to rest afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted with this display of wit, the Lepailleurs burst into noisy
      merriment. Oh! their boy would do great things, that was quite certain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, her heart oppressed by thought of the mourning which awaited
      her, had hitherto kept silent. She now asked, however, why little Therese
      did not form one of the party. Lepailleur dryly replied that he did not
      choose to embarrass himself with a child but six years old, who did not
      know how to behave. Her arrival had upset everything in the house; things
      would have been much better if she had never been born. Then, as Marianne
      began to protest, saying that she had seldom seen a more intelligent and
      prettier little girl, Madame Lepailleur answered more gently: &ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s
      sharp; that&rsquo;s true enough; but one can&rsquo;t send girls to Paris. She&rsquo;ll have
      to be put somewhere, and it will mean a lot of trouble, a lot of money.
      However, we mustn&rsquo;t talk about all that this morning, since we want to
      enjoy ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the train reached Paris, and the Lepailleurs, leaving the Northern
      terminus, were caught and carried off by the impetuously streaming crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu and Marianne alighted from their cab on the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, in
      front of the Beauchenes&rsquo; residence, they recognized the Seguins&rsquo; brougham
      drawn up beside the foot pavement. And within it they perceived the two
      girls, Lucie and Andree, waiting mute and motionless in their
      light-colored dresses. Then, as they approached the door, they saw
      Valentine come out, in a very great hurry as usual. On recognizing them,
      however, she assumed an expression of deep pity, and spoke the words
      required by the situation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a frightful misfortune, is it not? an only son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she burst out into a flood of words: &ldquo;You have hastened here, I see,
      as I did; it is only natural. I heard of the catastrophe only by chance
      less than an hour ago. And you see my luck! My daughters were dressed, and
      I myself was dressing to take them to a wedding&mdash;a cousin of our
      friend Santerre is marrying a diplomatist. And, in addition, I am engaged
      for the whole afternoon. Well, although the wedding is fixed for a
      quarter-past eleven, I did not hesitate, but drove here before going to
      the church. And naturally I went upstairs alone. My daughters have been
      waiting in the carriage. We shall no doubt be a little late for the
      wedding. But no matter! You will see the poor parents in their empty
      house, near the body, which, I must say, they have laid out very nicely on
      the bed. Oh! it is heartrending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was looking at her, surprised to see that she did not age. The
      fiery flame of her wild life seemed to scorch and preserve her. He knew
      that her home was now completely wrecked. Seguin openly lived with Nora,
      the governess, for whom he had furnished a little house. It was there even
      that he had given Mathieu an appointment to sign the final transfer of the
      Chantebled property. And since Gaston had entered the military college of
      St. Cyr, Valentine had only her two daughters with her in the spacious,
      luxurious mansion of the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, which ruin was slowly destroying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; resumed Madame Seguin, &ldquo;that I shall tell Gaston to obtain
      permission to attend the funeral. For I am not sure whether his father is
      in Paris. It&rsquo;s just the same with our friend Santerre; he&rsquo;s starting on a
      tour to-morrow. Ah! not only do the dead leave us, but it is astonishing
      what a number of the living go off and disappear! Life is very sad, is it
      not, dear madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke a little quiver passed over her face; the dread of the coming
      rupture, which she had felt approaching for several months past, amid all
      the skilful preparations of Santerre, who had been long maturing some
      secret plan, which she did not as yet divine. However, she made a devout
      ecstatic gesture, and added: &ldquo;Well, we are in the hands of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, who was still smiling at the ever-motionless girls in the closed
      brougham, changed the subject. &ldquo;How tall they have grown, how pretty they
      have become! Your Andree looks adorable. How old is your Lucie now? She
      will soon be of an age to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t let her hear you,&rdquo; retorted Valentine; &ldquo;you would make her
      burst into tears! She is seventeen, but for sense she isn&rsquo;t twelve. Would
      you believe it, she began sobbing this morning and refusing to go to the
      wedding, under the pretence that it would make her ill? She is always
      talking of convents; we shall have to come to a decision about her.
      Andree, though she is only thirteen, is already much more womanly. But she
      is a little stupid, just like a sheep. Her gentleness quite upsets me at
      times; it jars on my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Valentine, on the point of getting into her carriage, turned to shake
      hands with Marianne, and thought of inquiring after her health. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;I lose my head at times. I was quite forgetting. And the baby
      you&rsquo;re expecting will be your eleventh child, will it now? How terrible!
      Still it succeeds with you. And, ah! those poor people whom you are going
      to see, their house will be quite empty now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the brougham had rolled away it occurred to Mathieu and Marianne that
      before seeing the Beauchenes it might be advisable for them to call at the
      little pavilion, where their son or their daughter-in-law might be able to
      give them some useful information. But neither Blaise nor Charlotte was
      there. They found only a servant who was watching over the little girl,
      Berthe. This servant declared that she had not seen Monsieur Blaise since
      the previous day, for he had remained at the Beauchenes&rsquo; near the body.
      And as for Madame, she also had gone there early that morning, and had
      left instructions that Berthe was to be brought to her at noon, in order
      that she might not have to come back to give her the breast. Then, as
      Marianne in surprise began to put some questions, the girl explained
      matters: &ldquo;Madame took a box of drawing materials with her. I fancy that
      she is painting a portrait of the poor young man who is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mathieu and Marianne crossed the courtyard of the works, they felt
      oppressed by the grave-like silence which reigned in that great city of
      labor, usually so full of noise and bustle. Death had suddenly passed by,
      and all the ardent life had at once ceased, the machinery had become cold
      and mute, the workshops silent and deserted. There was not a sound, not a
      soul, not a puff of that vapor which was like the very breath of the
      place. Its master dead, it had died also. And the distress of the Froments
      increased when they passed from the works into the house, amid absolute
      solitude; the connecting gallery was wrapt in slumber, the staircase
      quivered amid the heavy silence, all the doors were open, as in some
      uninhabited house, long since deserted. They found no servant in the
      antechamber, and even the dim drawing-room, where the blinds of
      embroidered muslin were lowered, while the armchairs were arranged in a
      circle, as on reception days, when numerous visitors were expected, at
      first seemed to them to be empty. But at last they detected a shadowy form
      moving slowly to and fro in the middle of the room. It was Morange,
      bareheaded and frock-coated; he had hastened thither at the first news
      with the same air as if he had been repairing to his office. He seemed to
      be at home; it was he who received the visitors in a scared way, overcome
      as he was by this sudden demise, which recalled to him his daughter&rsquo;s
      abominable death. His heart-wound had reopened; he was livid, all in
      disorder, with his long gray beard streaming down, while he stepped hither
      and thither without a pause, making all the surrounding grief his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he recognized the Froments he also spoke the words which came
      from every tongue: &ldquo;What a frightful misfortune, an only son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pressed their hands, and whispered and explained that Madame
      Beauchene, feeling quite exhausted, had withdrawn for a few moments, and
      that Beauchene and Blaise were making necessary arrangements downstairs.
      And then, resuming his maniacal perambulations, he pointed towards an
      adjoining room, the folding doors of which were wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there, on the bed where he died. There are flowers; it looks very
      nice. You may go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This room was Maurice&rsquo;s bedchamber. The large curtains had been closely
      drawn, and tapers were burning near the bed, casting a soft light on the
      deceased&rsquo;s face, which appeared very calm, very white, the eyes closed as
      if in sleep. Between the clasped hands rested a crucifix, and with the
      roses scattered over the sheet the bed was like a couch of springtide. The
      odor of the flowers, mingling with that of the burning wax, seemed rather
      oppressive amid the deep and tragic stillness. Not a breath stirred the
      tall, erect flames of the tapers, burning in the semi-obscurity, amid
      which the bed alone showed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu and Marianne had gone in, they perceived their
      daughter-in-law, Charlotte, behind a screen near the door. Lighted by a
      little lamp, she sat there with a sketching-block on her knees, making a
      drawing of Maurice&rsquo;s head as it rested among the roses. Hard and
      anguish-bringing as was such work for one with so young a heart, she had
      nevertheless yielded to the mother&rsquo;s ardent entreaties. And for three
      hours past, pale, looking wondrously beautiful, her face showing all the
      flower of youth, her blue eyes opening widely under her fine golden hair,
      she had been there diligently working, striving to do her best. When
      Mathieu and Marianne approached her she would not speak, but simply
      nodded. Still a little color came to her cheeks, and her eyes smiled. And
      when the others, after lingering there for a moment in sorrowful
      contemplation, had quietly returned to the drawing-room, she resumed her
      work alone, in the presence of the dead, among the roses and the tapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morange was still walking the drawing-room like a lost, wandering phantom.
      Mathieu remained standing there, while Marianne sat down near the folding
      doors. Not another word was exchanged; the spell of waiting continued amid
      the oppressive silence of the dim, closed room. When some ten minutes had
      elapsed, two other visitors arrived, a lady and a gentleman, whom the
      Froments could not at first recognize. Morange bowed and received them in
      his dazed way. Then, as the lady did not release her hold of the
      gentleman&rsquo;s hand, but led him along, as if he were blind, between the
      articles of furniture, so that he might not knock against them, Marianne
      and Mathieu realized that the new comers were the Angelins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the previous winter they had sold their little house at Janville to
      fix themselves in Paris, for a last misfortune had befallen them&mdash;the
      failure of a great banking house had carried away almost the whole of
      their modest fortune. The wife had fortunately secured a post as one of
      the delegates of the Poor Relief Board, an inspectorship with various
      duties, such as watching over the mothers and children assisted by the
      board, and reporting thereon. And she was wont to say, with a sad smile,
      that this work of looking after the little ones was something of a
      consolation for her, since it was now certain that she would never have a
      child of her own. As for her husband, whose eyesight was failing more and
      more, he had been obliged to relinquish painting altogether, and he
      dragged out his days in morose desolation, his life wrecked, annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With short steps, as if she were leading a child, Madame Angelin brought
      him to an armchair near Marianne and seated him in it. He had retained the
      lofty mien of a musketeer, but his features had been ravaged by anxiety,
      and his hair was white, though he was only forty-four years of age. And
      what memories arose at the sight of that sorrowful lady leading that
      infirm, aged man, for those who had known the young couple, all tenderness
      and good looks, rambling along the secluded paths of Janville, amid the
      careless delights of their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Madame Angelin had clasped Marianne&rsquo;s hands with her own
      trembling fingers, she also uttered in low, stammering accents, those
      despairing words: &ldquo;Ah! what a frightful misfortune, an only son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled with tears, and she would not sit down before going for a
      moment to see the body in the adjoining room. When she came back, sobbing
      in her handkerchief, she sank into an armchair between Marianne and her
      husband. He remained there motionless, staring fixedly with his dim eyes.
      And silence fell again throughout the lifeless house, whither the rumble
      of the works, now deserted, fireless and frozen, ascended no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchene, followed by Blaise, at last made his appearance. The heavy
      blow he had received seemed to have made him ten years older. It was as if
      the heavens had suddenly fallen upon him. Never amid his conquering
      egotism, his pride of strength and his pleasures, had he imagined such a
      downfall to be possible. Never had he been willing to admit that Maurice
      might be ill&mdash;such an idea was like casting a doubt upon his own
      strength; he thought himself beyond the reach of thunderbolts; misfortune
      would never dare to fall on him. And at the first overwhelming moment he
      had found himself weak as a woman, weary and limp, his strength undermined
      by his dissolute life, the slow disorganization of his faculties. He had
      sobbed like a child before his dead son, all his vanity crushed, all his
      calculations destroyed. The thunderbolt had sped by, and nothing remained.
      In a minute his life had been swept away; the world was now all black and
      void. And he remained livid, in consternation at it all, his bloated face
      swollen with grief, his heavy eyelids red with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he perceived the Froments, weakness again came upon him, and he
      staggered towards them with open arms, once more stifling with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear friends, what a terrible blow! And I wasn&rsquo;t here! When I got
      here he had lost consciousness; he did not recognize me&mdash;. Is it
      possible? A lad who was in such good health! I cannot believe it. It seems
      to me that I must be dreaming, and that he will get up presently and come
      down with me into the workshops!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They kissed him, they pitied him, struck down like this upon his return
      from some carouse or other, still intoxicated, perhaps, and tumbling into
      the midst of such an awful disaster, his prostration increased by the
      stupor following upon debauchery. His beard, moist with his tears, still
      stank of tobacco and musk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he scarcely knew the Angelins, he pressed them also in his arms.
      &ldquo;Ah! my poor friends, what a terrible blow! What a terrible blow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Blaise in his turn came to kiss his parents. In spite of his grief,
      and the horrible night he had spent, his face retained its youthful
      freshness. Yet tears coursed down his cheeks, for, working with Maurice
      day by day, he had conceived real friendship for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence fell again. Morange, as if unconscious of what went on around
      him, as if he were quite alone there, continued walking softly hither and
      thither like a somnambulist. Beauchene, with haggard mien, went off, and
      then came back carrying some little address-books. He turned about for
      another moment, and finally sat down at a writing-table which had been
      brought out of Maurice&rsquo;s room. Little accustomed as he was to grief, he
      instinctively sought to divert his mind, and began searching in the little
      address-books for the purpose of drawing up a list of the persons who must
      be invited to the funeral. But his eyes became blurred, and with a gesture
      he summoned Blaise, who, after going into the bedchamber to glance at his
      wife&rsquo;s sketch, was now returning to the drawing-room. Thereupon the young
      man, standing erect beside the writing-table, began to dictate the names
      in a low voice; and then, amid the deep silence sounded a low and
      monotonous murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes slowly went by. The visitors were still waiting for Constance.
      At last a little door of the death-chamber slowly opened, and she entered
      that chamber noiselessly, without anybody knowing that she was there. She
      looked like a spectre emerging out of the darkness into the pale light of
      the tapers. She had not yet wept; her face was livid, contracted, hardened
      by cold rage. Her little figure, instead of bending, seemed to have grown
      taller beneath the injustice of destiny, as if borne up by furious
      rebellion. Yet her loss did not surprise her. She had immediately felt
      that she had expected it, although but a minute before the death she had
      stubbornly refused to believe it possible. But the thought of it had
      remained latent within her for long months, and frightful evidence thereof
      now burst forth. She suddenly heard the whispers of the unknown once more,
      and understood them; she knew the meaning of those shivers which had
      chilled her, those vague, terror-fraught regrets at having no other child!
      And that which had been threatening her had come; irreparable destiny had
      willed it that her only son, the salvation of the imperilled home, the
      prince of to-morrow, who was to share his empire with her, should be swept
      away like a withered leaf. It was utter downfall; she sank into an abyss.
      And she remained tearless; fury dried her tears within her. Yet, good
      mother that she had always been, she suffered all the torment of
      motherliness exasperated, poisoned by the loss of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew near to Charlotte and paused behind her, looking at the profile
      of her dead son resting among the flowers. And still she did not weep. She
      slowly gazed over the bed, filled her eyes with the dolorous scene, then
      carried them again to the paper, as if to see what would be left her of
      that adored son&mdash;those few pencil strokes&mdash;when the earth should
      have taken him forever. Charlotte, divining that somebody was behind her,
      started and raised her head. She did not speak; she had felt frightened.
      But both women exchanged a glance. And what a heart pang came to
      Constance, amid that display of death, in the presence of the void, the
      nothingness that was hers, as she gazed on the other&rsquo;s face, all love and
      health and beauty, suggesting some youthful star, whence promise of the
      future radiated through the fine gold of wavy hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet another pang came to Constance at that moment: words which were
      being whispered in the drawing-room, near the door of the bedchamber,
      reached her distinctly. She did not move, but remained erect behind
      Charlotte, who had resumed her work. And eagerly lending ear, she
      listened, not showing herself as yet, although she had already seen
      Marianne and Madame Angelin seated near the doorway, almost among the
      folds of the hangings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Madame Angelin was saying, &ldquo;the poor mother had a presentiment of
      it, as it were. I saw that she felt very anxious when I told her my own
      sad story. There is no hope for me; and now death has passed by, and no
      hope remains for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence ensued once more; then, prompted by some connecting train of
      thought, she went on: &ldquo;And your next child will be your eleventh, will it
      not? Eleven is not a number; you will surely end by having twelve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Constance heard those words she shuddered in another fit of that fury
      which dried up her tears. By glancing sideways she could see that mother
      of ten children, who was now expecting yet an eleventh child. She found
      her still young, still fresh, overflowing with joy and health and hope.
      And she was there, like the goddess of fruitfulness, nigh to the funeral
      bier at that hour of the supreme rending, when she, Constance, was bowed
      down by the irretrievable loss of her only child.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marianne was answering Madame Angelin: &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t think that at all
      likely. Why, I&rsquo;m becoming an old woman. You forget that I am already a
      grandmother. Here, look at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she waved her hand towards the servant of her daughter-in-law,
      Charlotte, who, in accordance with the instructions she had received, was
      now bringing the little Berthe in order that her mother might give her the
      breast. The servant had remained at the drawing-room door, hesitating,
      disliking to intrude on all that mourning; but the child good-humoredly
      waved her fat little fists, and laughed lightly. And Charlotte, hearing
      her, immediately rose and tripped across the salon to take the little one
      into a neighboring room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty child!&rdquo; murmured Madame Angelin. &ldquo;Those little ones are
      like nosegays; they bring brightness and freshness wherever they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance for her part had been dazzled. All at once, amid the
      semi-obscurity, starred by the flames of the tapers, amid the deathly
      atmosphere, which the odor of the roses rendered the more oppressive, that
      laughing child had set a semblance of budding springtime, the fresh,
      bright atmosphere of a long promise of life. And it typified the victory
      of fruitfulness; it was the child&rsquo;s child, it was Marianne reviving in her
      son&rsquo;s daughter. A grandmother already, and she was only forty-one years
      old! Marianne had smiled at that thought. But the hatchet-stroke rang out
      yet more frightfully in Constance&rsquo;s heart. In her case the tree was cut
      down to its very root, the sole scion had been lopped off, and none would
      ever sprout again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For yet another moment she remained alone amid that nothingness, in that
      room where lay her son&rsquo;s remains. Then she made up her mind and passed
      into the drawing-room, with the air of a frozen spectre. They all rose,
      kissed her, and shivered as their lips touched her cold cheeks, which her
      blood was unable to warm. Profound compassion wrung them, so frightful was
      her calmness. And they sought kind words to say to her, but she curtly
      stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;there is nothing to be said. Everything is
      ended, quite ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Angelin sobbed, Angelin himself wiped his poor fixed, blurred eyes.
      Marianne and Mathieu shed tears while retaining Constance&rsquo;s hands in
      theirs. And she, rigid and still unable to weep, refused consolation,
      repeating in monotonous accents: &ldquo;It is finished; nothing can give him
      back to me. Is it not so? And thus there remains nothing; all is ended,
      quite ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She needed to be brave, for visitors would soon be arriving in a stream.
      But a last stab in the heart was reserved for her. Beauchene, who since
      her arrival had begun to cry again, could no longer see to write.
      Moreover, his hand trembled, and he had to leave the writing-table and
      fling himself into an armchair, saying to Blaise: &ldquo;There sit down there,
      and continue to write for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Constance saw Blaise seat himself at her son&rsquo;s writing-table, in his
      place, dip his pen in the inkstand and begin to write with the very same
      gesture that she had so often seen Maurice make. That Blaise, that son of
      the Froments! What! her dear boy was not yet buried, and a Froment already
      replaced him, even as vivacious, fast-growing plants overrun neighboring
      barren fields. That stream of life flowing around her, intent on universal
      conquest, seemed yet more threatening; grandmothers still bore children,
      daughters suckled already, sons laid hands upon vacant kingdoms. And she
      remained alone; she had but her unworthy, broken-down, worn-out husband
      beside her; while Morange, the maniac, incessantly walking to and fro, was
      like the symbolical spectre of human distress, one whose heart and
      strength and reason had been carried away in the frightful death of his
      only daughter. And not a sound came from the cold and empty works; the
      works themselves were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral ceremony two days later was an imposing one. The five hundred
      workmen of the establishment followed the hearse, notabilities of all
      sorts made up an immense cortege. It was much noticed that an old workman,
      father Moineaud, the oldest hand of the works, was one of the
      pall-bearers. Indeed, people thought it touching, although the worthy old
      man dragged his legs somewhat, and looked quite out of his element in a
      frock coat, stiffened as he was by thirty years&rsquo; hard toil. In the
      cemetery, near the grave, Mathieu felt surprised on being approached by an
      old lady who alighted from one of the mourning-coaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, my friend,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you do not recognize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of apology. It was Seraphine, still tall and slim, but
      so fleshless, so withered that one might have thought she was a hundred
      years old. Cecile had warned Mathieu of it, yet if he had not seen her
      himself he would never have believed that her proud insolent beauty, which
      had seemed to defy time and excesses, could have faded so swiftly. What
      frightful, withering blast could have swept over her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my friend,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I am more dead than the poor fellow whom
      they are about to lower into that grave. Come and have a chat with me some
      day. You are the only person to whom I can tell everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coffin was lowered, the ropes gave out a creaking sound, and there
      came a little thud&mdash;the last. Beauchene, supported by a relative,
      looked on with dim, vacant eyes. Constance, who had had the bitter courage
      to come, and had now wept all the tears in her body, almost fainted. She
      was carried away, driven back to her home, which would now forever be
      empty, like one of those stricken fields that remain barren, fated to
      perpetual sterility. Mother earth had taken back her all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at Chantebled Mathieu and Marianne founded, created, increased, and
      multiplied, again proving victorious in the eternal battle which life
      wages against death, thanks to that continual increase, both of offspring
      and of fertile land, which was like their very existence, their joy and
      their strength. Desire passed like a gust of flame, desire divine and
      fruitful, since they possessed the power of love, kindliness, and health.
      And their energy did the rest&mdash;that will of action, that quiet
      bravery in the presence of the labor that is requisite, the labor that has
      made and that regulates the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, during those two years it was not without constant battling that
      victory remained to them. At last it was complete. Piece by piece Seguin
      had sold the entire estate, of which Mathieu was now king, thanks to his
      prudent system of conquest, that of increasing his empire by degrees as he
      gradually felt himself stronger. The fortune which the idler had disdained
      and dissipated had passed into the hands of the toiler, the creator. There
      were 1250 acres, spreading from horizon to horizon; there were woods
      intersected by broad meadows, where flocks and herds pastured; there was
      fat land overflowing with harvests, in the place of marshes that had been
      drained; there was other land, each year of increasing fertility, in the
      place of the moors which the captured springs now irrigated. The
      Lepailleurs&rsquo; uncultivated enclosure alone remained, as if to bear witness
      to the prodigy, the great human effort which had quickened that desert of
      sand and mud, whose crops would henceforth nourish so many happy people.
      Mathieu devoured no other man&rsquo;s share; he had brought his share into
      being, increasing the common wealth, subjugating yet another small portion
      of this vast world, which is still so scantily peopled and so badly
      utilized for human happiness. The farm, the homestead, had sprung up and
      grown in the centre of the estate like a prosperous township, with
      inhabitants, servants, and live stock, a perfect focus of ardent triumphal
      life. And what sovereign power was that of the happy fruitfulness which
      had never wearied of creating, which had yielded all these beings and
      things that had been increasing and multiplying for twelve years past,
      that invading town which was but a family&rsquo;s expansion, those trees, those
      plants, those grain crops, those fruits whose nourishing stream ever rose
      under the dazzling sun! All pain and all tears were forgotten in that joy
      of creation, the accomplishment of due labor, the conquest of the future
      conducting to the infinite of Action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while Mathieu completed his work of conquest, Marianne during those
      two years had the happiness of seeing a daughter born to her son Blaise,
      even while she herself was expecting another child. The branches of the
      huge tree had begun to fork, pending the time when they would ramify
      endlessly, like the branches of some great royal oak spreading afar over
      the soil. There would be her children&rsquo;s children, her grandchildren&rsquo;s
      children, the whole posterity increasing from generation to generation.
      And yet how carefully and lovingly she still assembled around her her own
      first brood, from Blaise and Denis the twins, now one-and-twenty, to the
      last born, the wee creature who sucked in life from her bosom with greedy
      lips. There were some of all ages in the brood&mdash;a big fellow, who was
      already a father; others who went to school; others who still had to be
      dressed in the morning; there were boys, Ambroise, Gervais, Gregoire, and
      another; there were girls, Rose, nearly old enough to marry; Claire,
      Louise, Madeleine, and Marguerite, the last of whom could scarcely toddle.
      And it was a sight to see them roam over the estate like a troop of colts,
      following one another at varied pace, according to their growth. She knew
      that she could not keep them all tied to her apron-strings; it would be
      sufficient happiness if the farm kept two or three beside her; she
      resigned herself to seeing the younger ones go off some day to conquer
      other lands. Such was the law of expansion; the earth was the heritage of
      the most numerous race. Since they had number on their side, they would
      have strength also; the world would belong to them. The parents themselves
      had felt stronger, more united at the advent of each fresh child. If in
      spite of terrible cares they had always conquered, it was because their
      love, their toil, the ceaseless travail of their heart and will, gave them
      the victory. Fruitfulness is the great conqueress; from her come the
      pacific heroes who subjugate the world by peopling it. And this time
      especially, when at the lapse of those two years Marianne gave birth to a
      boy, Nicolas, her eleventh child, Mathieu embraced her passionately,
      triumphing over every sorrow and every pang. Yet another child; yet more
      wealth and power; yet an additional force born into the world; another
      field ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas ever the great work, the good work, the work of fruitfulness
      spreading, thanks to the earth and thanks to woman, both victorious over
      destruction, offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child
      was born, and loving, willing, battling, toiling even amid suffering, and
      ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      AMID the deep mourning life slowly resumed its course at the Beauchene
      works. One effect of the terrible blow which had fallen on Beauchene was
      that for some weeks he remained quietly at home. Indeed, he seemed to have
      profited by the terrible lesson, for he no longer coined lies, no longer
      invented pressing business journeys as a pretext for dissipation. He even
      set to work once more, and busied himself about the factory, coming down
      every morning as in his younger days. And in Blaise he found an active and
      devoted lieutenant, on whom he each day cast more and more of the heavier
      work. Intimates were most struck, however, by the manner in which
      Beauchene and his wife drew together again. Constance was most attentive
      to her husband; Beauchene no longer left her, and they seemed to agree
      well together, leading a very retired life in their quiet house, where
      only relatives were now received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, on the morrow of Maurice&rsquo;s sudden death, was like one who has
      just lost a limb. It seemed to her that she was no longer whole; she felt
      ashamed of being, as it were, disfigured. Mingled, too, with her loving
      sorrow for Maurice there was humiliation at the thought that she was no
      longer a mother, that she no longer had any heir-apparent to her kingdom
      beside her. To think that she had been so stubbornly determined to have
      but one son, one child, in order that he might become the sole master of
      the family fortune, the all-powerful monarch of the future. Death had
      stolen him from her, and the establishment now seemed to be less her own,
      particularly since that fellow Blaise and his wife and his child,
      representing those fruitful and all-invading Froments, were installed
      there. She could no longer console herself for having welcomed and lodged
      them, and her one passionate, all-absorbing desire was to have another
      son, and thereby reconquer her empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      This it was which led to her reconciliation with her husband, and for six
      months they lived together on the best of terms. Then, however, came
      another six months, and it was evident that they no longer agreed so well
      together, for Beauchene took himself off at times under the pretext of
      seeking fresh air, and Constance remained at home, feverish, her eyes red
      with weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mathieu, who had come to Grenelle to see his daughter-in-law,
      Charlotte, was lingering in the garden playing with little Berthe, who had
      climbed upon his knees, when he was surprised by the sudden approach of
      Constance, who must have seen him from her windows. She invented a pretext
      to draw him into the house, and kept him there nearly a quarter of an hour
      before she could make up her mind to speak her thoughts. Then, all at
      once, she began: &ldquo;My dear Mathieu, you must forgive me for mentioning a
      painful matter, but there are reasons why I should do so. Nearly fifteen
      years ago, I know it for a fact, my husband had a child by a girl who was
      employed at the works. And I also know that you acted as his intermediary
      on that occasion, and made certain arrangements with respect to that girl
      and her child&mdash;a boy, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a reply. But Mathieu, stupefied at finding her so well
      informed, and at a loss to understand why she spoke to him of that sorry
      affair after the lapse of so many years, could only make a gesture by
      which he betrayed both his surprise and his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I do not address any reproach to you; I am convinced that
      your motives were quite friendly, even affectionate, and that you wished
      to hush up a scandal which might have been very unpleasant for me.
      Moreover, I do not desire to indulge in recriminations after so long a
      time. My desire is simply for information. For a long time I did not care
      to investigate the statements whereby I was informed of the affair. But
      the recollection of it comes back to me and haunts me persistently, and it
      is natural that I should apply to you. I have never spoken a word on the
      subject to my husband, and indeed it is best for our tranquillity that I
      should not attempt to extort a detailed confession from him. One
      circumstance which has induced me to speak to you is that on an occasion
      when I accompanied Madame Angelin to a house in the Rue de Miromesnil, I
      perceived you there with that girl, who had another child in her arms. So
      you have not lost sight of her, and you must know what she is doing, and
      whether her first child is alive, and in that case where he is, and how he
      is situated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu still refrained from replying, for Constance&rsquo;s increasing
      feverishness put him on his guard, and impelled him to seek the motive of
      such a strange application on the part of one who was as a rule so proud
      and so discreet. What could be happening? Why did she strive to provoke
      confidential revelations which might have far-reaching effects? Then, as
      she closely scanned him with her keen eyes, he sought to answer her with
      kind, evasive words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You greatly embarrass me. And, besides, I know nothing likely to interest
      you. What good would it do yourself or your husband to stir up all the
      dead past? Take my advice, forget what people may have told you&mdash;you
      are so sensible and prudent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she interrupted him, caught hold of his hands, and held them in her
      warm, quivering grasp. Never before had she so behaved, forgetting and
      surrendering herself so passionately. &ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that nobody
      has anything to fear from me&mdash;neither my husband, nor that girl, nor
      the child. Cannot you understand me? I am simply tormented; I suffer at
      knowing nothing. Yes, it seems to me that I shall feel more at ease when I
      know the truth. It is for myself that I question you, for my own peace of
      mind.... Ah! if I could only tell you, if I could tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to divine many things; it was unnecessary for her to be more
      explicit. He knew that during the past year she and her husband had been
      hoping for the advent of a second child, and that none had come. As a
      woman, Constance felt no jealousy of Norine, but as a mother she was
      jealous of her son. She could not drive the thought of that child from her
      mind; it ever and ever returned thither like a mocking insult now that her
      hopes of replacing Maurice were fading fast. Day by day did she dream more
      and more passionately of the other woman&rsquo;s son, wondering where he was,
      what had become of him, whether he were healthy, and whether he resembled
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, my dear Mathieu,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that you will really bring
      me relief by answering me. Is he alive? Tell me simply whether he is
      alive. But do not tell me a lie. If he is dead I think that I shall feel
      calmer. And yet, good heavens! I certainly wish him no evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu, who felt deeply touched, told her the simple truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you insist on it, for the benefit of your peace of mind, and since
      it is to remain entirely between us and to have no effect on your home, I
      see no reason why I should not confide to you what I know. But that is
      very little. The child was left at the Foundling Hospital in my presence.
      Since then the mother, having never asked for news, has received none. I
      need not add that your husband is equally ignorant, for he always refused
      to have anything to do with the child. Is the lad still alive? Where is
      he? Those are things which I cannot tell you. A long inquiry would be
      necessary. If, however, you wish for my opinion, I think it probable that
      he is dead, for the mortality among these poor cast-off children is very
      great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance looked at him fixedly. &ldquo;You are telling me the real truth? You
      are hiding nothing?&rdquo; she asked. And as he began to protest, she went on:
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I have confidence in you. And so you believe that he is dead!
      Ah! to think of all those children who die, when so many women would be
      happy to save one, to have one for themselves. Well, if you haven&rsquo;t been
      able to tell me anything positive, you have at least done your best. Thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the ensuing months Mathieu often found himself alone with
      Constance, but she never reverted to the subject. She seemed to set her
      energy on forgetting all about it, though he divined that it still haunted
      her. Meantime things went from bad to worse in the Beauchene household.
      The husband gradually went back to his former life of debauchery, in spite
      of all the efforts of Constance to keep him near her. She, for her part,
      clung to her fixed idea, and before long she consulted Boutan. There was a
      terrible scene that day between husband and wife in the doctor&rsquo;s presence.
      Constance raked up the story of Norine and cast it in Beauchene&rsquo;s teeth,
      while he upbraided her in a variety of ways. However, Boutan&rsquo;s advice,
      though followed for a time, proved unavailing, and she at last lost
      confidence in him. Then she spent months and months in consulting one and
      another. She placed herself in the hands of Madame Bourdieu, she even went
      to see La Rouche, she applied to all sorts of charlatans, exasperated to
      fury at finding that there was no real succor for her. She might long ago
      have had a family had she so chosen. But she had elected otherwise,
      setting all her egotism and pride on that only son whom death had snatched
      away; and now the motherhood she longed for was denied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly two years did Constance battle, and at last in despair she was
      seized with the idea of consulting Dr. Gaude. He told her the brutal
      truth; it was useless for her to address herself to charlatans; she would
      simply be robbed by them; there was absolutely no hope for her. And Gaude
      uttered those decisive words in a light, jesting way, as though surprised
      and amused by her profound grief. She almost fainted on the stairs as she
      left his flat, and for a moment indeed death seemed welcome. But by a
      great effort of will she recovered self-possession, the courage to face
      the life of loneliness that now lay before her. Moreover, another idea
      vaguely dawned upon her, and the first time she found herself alone with
      Mathieu she again spoke to him of Norine&rsquo;s boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for reverting to a painful subject, but I am
      suffering too much now that I know there is no hope for me. I am haunted
      by the thought of that illegitimate child of my husband&rsquo;s. Will you do me
      a great service? Make the inquiry you once spoke to me about, try to find
      out if he is alive or dead. I feel that when I know the facts peace may
      perhaps return to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was almost on the point of answering her that, even if this child
      were found again, it could hardly cure her of her grief at having no child
      of her own. He had divined her agony at seeing Blaise take Maurice&rsquo;s place
      at the works now that Beauchene had resumed his dissolute life, and daily
      intrusted the young man with more and more authority. Blaise&rsquo;s home was
      prospering too; Charlotte had now given birth to a second child, a boy,
      and thus fruitfulness was invading the place and usurpation becoming more
      and more likely, since Constance could never more have an heir to bar the
      road of conquest. Without penetrating her singular feelings, Mathieu
      fancied that she perhaps wished to sound him to ascertain if he were not
      behind Blaise, urging on the work of spoliation. She possibly imagined
      that her request would make him anxious, and that he would refuse to make
      the necessary researches. At this idea he decided to do as she desired, if
      only to show her that he was above all the base calculations of ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your disposal, cousin,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is enough for me that this
      inquiry may give you a little relief. But if the lad is alive, am I to
      bring him to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no, I do not ask that!&rdquo; And then, gesticulating almost wildly,
      she stammered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want, but I suffer so dreadfully that
      I am scarce able to live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact a tempest raged within her, but she really had no settled
      plan. One could hardly say that she really thought of that boy as a
      possible heir. In spite of her hatred of all conquerors from without, was
      it likely that she would accept him as a conqueror, in the face of her
      outraged womanly feelings and her bourgeois horror of illegitimacy? And
      yet if he were not her son, he was at least her husband&rsquo;s. And perhaps an
      idea of saving her empire by placing the works in the hands of that heir
      was dimly rising within her, above all her prejudices and her rancor. But
      however that might be, her feelings for the time remained confused, and
      the only clear thing was her desperate torment at being now and forever
      childless, a torment which goaded her on to seek another&rsquo;s child with the
      wild idea of making that child in some slight degree her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, however, asked her, &ldquo;Am I to inform Beauchene of the steps I
      take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you as you please,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Still, that would be the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That same evening there came a complete rupture between herself and her
      husband. She threw in Beauchene&rsquo;s face all the contempt and loathing that
      she had felt for him for years. Hopeless as she was, she revenged herself
      by telling him everything that she had on her heart and mind. And her slim
      dark figure, upborne by bitter rage, assumed such redoubtable proportions
      in his eyes that he felt frightened by her and fled. Henceforth they were
      husband and wife in name only. It was logic on the march, it was the
      inevitable disorganization of a household reaching its climax, it was
      rebellion against nature&rsquo;s law and indulgence in vice leading to the
      gradual decline of a man of intelligence, it was a hard worker sinking
      into the sloth of so-called pleasure; and then, death having snatched away
      the only son, the home broke to pieces&mdash;the wife&mdash;fated to
      childlessness, and the husband driven away by her, rolling through
      debauchery towards final ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu, keeping his promise to Constance, discreetly began his
      researches. And before he even consulted Beauchene it occurred to him to
      apply at the Foundling Hospital. If, as he anticipated, the child were
      dead, the affair would go no further. Fortunately enough he remembered all
      the particulars: the two names, Alexandre-Honore, given to the child, the
      exact date of the deposit at the hospital, indeed all the little incidents
      of the day when he had driven thither with La Couteau. And when he was
      received by the director of the establishment, and had explained to him
      the real motives of his inquiries, at the same time giving his name, he
      was surprised by the promptness and precision of the answer:
      Alexandre-Honore, put out to nurse with the woman Loiseau at Rougemont,
      had first kept cows, and had then tried the calling of a locksmith; but
      for three months past he had been in apprenticeship with a wheelwright, a
      certain Montoir, residing at Saint-Pierre, a hamlet in the vicinity of
      Rougemont. Thus the lad lived; he was fifteen years old, and that was all.
      Mathieu could obtain no further information respecting either his physical
      health or his morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu found himself in the street again, slightly dazed, he
      remembered that La Couteau had told him that the child would be sent to
      Rougemont. He had always pictured it dying there, carried off by the
      hurricane which killed so many babes, and lying in the silent village
      cemetery paved with little Parisians. To find the boy alive, saved from
      the massacre, came like a surprise of destiny, and brought vague anguish,
      a fear of some terrible catastrophe to Mathieu&rsquo;s heart. At the same time,
      since the boy was living, and he now knew where to seek him, he felt that
      he must warn Beauchene. The matter was becoming serious, and it seemed to
      him that he ought not to carry the inquiry any further without the
      father&rsquo;s authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day, then, before returning to Chantebled, he repaired to the
      factory, where he was lucky enough to find Beauchene, whom Blaise&rsquo;s
      absence on business had detained there by force. Thus he was in a very bad
      humor, puffing and yawning and half asleep. It was nearly three o&rsquo;clock,
      and he declared that he could never digest his lunch properly unless he
      went out afterwards. The truth was that since his rupture with his wife he
      had been devoting his afternoons to paying attentions to a girl serving at
      a beer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my good fellow,&rdquo; he muttered as he stretched himself. &ldquo;My blood is
      evidently thickening. I must bestir myself, or else I shall be in a bad
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, he woke up when Mathieu had explained the motive of his visit. At
      first he could scarcely understand it, for the affair seemed to him so
      extraordinary, so idiotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What do you say? It was my wife who spoke to you about that child? It
      is she who has taken it into her head to collect information and start a
      search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fat apoplectical face became distorted, his anger was so violent that
      he could scarcely stutter. When he heard, however, of the mission with
      which his wife had intrusted Mathieu, he at last exploded: &ldquo;She is mad! I
      tell you that she is raving mad! Were such fancies ever seen? Every
      morning she invents something fresh to distract me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without heeding this interruption, Mathieu quietly finished his narrative:
      &ldquo;And so I have just come back from the Foundling Hospital, where I learnt
      that the boy is alive. I have his address&mdash;and now what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the final blow. Beauchene clenched his fists and raised his arms
      in exasperation. &ldquo;Ah! well, here&rsquo;s a nice state of things! But why on
      earth does she want to trouble me about that boy? He isn&rsquo;t hers! Why can&rsquo;t
      she leave us alone, the boy and me? It&rsquo;s my affair. And I ask you if it is
      at all proper for my wife to send you running about after him? Besides, I
      hope that you are not going to bring him to her. What on earth could we do
      with that little peasant, who may have every vice? Just picture him coming
      between us. I tell you that she is mad, mad, mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to walk angrily to and fro. All at once he stopped: &ldquo;My dear
      fellow, you will just oblige me by telling her that he is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he turned pale and recoiled. Constance stood on the threshold and had
      heard him. For some time past she had been in the habit of stealthily
      prowling around the offices, like one on the watch for something. For a
      moment, at the sight of the embarrassment which both men displayed, she
      remained silent. Then, without even addressing her husband, she asked: &ldquo;He
      is alive, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu could but tell her the truth. He answered with a nod. Then
      Beauchene, in despair, made a final effort: &ldquo;Come, be reasonable, my dear.
      As I was saying only just now, we don&rsquo;t even know what this youngster&rsquo;s
      character is. You surely don&rsquo;t want to upset our life for the mere
      pleasure of doing so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, lean and frigid, she gave him a harsh glance; then,
      turning her back on him, she demanded the child&rsquo;s name, and the names of
      the wheelwright and the locality. &ldquo;Good, you say Alexandre-Honore, with
      Montoir the wheelwright, at Saint-Pierre, near Rougemont, in Calvados.
      Well, my friend, oblige me by continuing your researches; endeavor to
      procure me some precise information about this boy&rsquo;s habits and
      disposition. Be prudent, too; don&rsquo;t give anybody&rsquo;s name. And thanks for
      what you have done already; thanks for all you are doing for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she took herself off without giving any further explanation,
      without even telling her husband of the vague plans she was forming.
      Beneath her crushing contempt he had grown calm again. Why should he spoil
      his life of egotistical pleasure by resisting that mad creature? All that
      he need do was to put on his hat and betake himself to his usual
      diversions. And so he ended by shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, let her pick him up if she chooses, it won&rsquo;t be my doing. Act
      as she asks you, my dear fellow; continue your researches and try to
      content her. Perhaps she will then leave me in peace. But I&rsquo;ve had quite
      enough of it for to-day; good-by, I&rsquo;m going out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the view of obtaining some information of Rougemont, Mathieu at first
      thought of applying to La Couteau, if he could find her again; for which
      purpose it occurred to him that he might call on Madame Bourdieu in the
      Rue de Miromesnil. But another and more certain means suggested itself. He
      had been led to renew his intercourse with the Seguins, of whom he had for
      a time lost sight; and, much to his surprise, he had found Valentine&rsquo;s
      former maid, Celeste, in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin once more. Through this woman,
      he thought, he might reach La Couteau direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The renewal of the intercourse between the Froments and the Seguins was
      due to a very happy chance. Mathieu&rsquo;s son Ambroise, on leaving college,
      had entered the employment of an uncle of Seguin&rsquo;s, Thomas du Hordel, one
      of the wealthiest commission merchants in Paris; and this old man, who,
      despite his years, remained very sturdy, and still directed his business
      with all the fire of youth, had conceived a growing fondness for Ambroise,
      who had great mental endowments and a real genius for commerce. Du
      Hordel&rsquo;s own children had consisted of two daughters, one of whom had died
      young, while the other had married a madman, who had lodged a bullet in
      his head and had left her childless and crazy like himself. This partially
      explained the deep grandfatherly interest which Du Hordel took in young
      Ambroise, who was the handsomest of all the Froments, with a clear
      complexion, large black eyes, brown hair that curled naturally, and
      manners of much refinement and elegance. But the old man was further
      captivated by the young fellow&rsquo;s spirit of enterprise, the four modern
      languages which he spoke so readily, and the evident mastery which he
      would some day show in the management of a business which extended over
      the five parts of the world. In his childhood, among his brothers and
      sisters, Ambroise had always been the boldest, most captivating and
      self-assertive. The others might be better than he, but he reigned over
      them like a handsome, ambitious, greedy boy, a future man of gayety and
      conquest. And this indeed he proved to be; by the charm of his victorious
      intellect he conquered old Du Hordel in a few months, even as later on he
      was destined to vanquish everybody and everything much as he pleased. His
      strength lay in his power of pleasing and his power of action, a blending
      of grace with the most assiduous industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Seguin and his uncle, who had never set foot in the house
      of the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin since insanity had reigned there, drew together
      again. Their apparent reconciliation was the outcome of a drama shrouded
      in secrecy. Seguin, hard up and in debt, cast off by Nora, who divined his
      approaching ruin, and preyed upon by other voracious creatures, had ended
      by committing, on the turf, one of those indelicate actions which honest
      people call thefts. Du Hordel, on being apprised of the matter, had
      hastened forward and had paid what was due in order to avoid a frightful
      scandal. And he was so upset by the extraordinary muddle in which he found
      his nephew&rsquo;s home, once all prosperity, that remorse came upon him as if
      he were in some degree responsible for what had happened, since he had
      egotistically kept away from his relatives for his own peace&rsquo;s sake. But
      he was more particularly won over by his grandniece Andree, now a
      delicious young girl well-nigh eighteen years of age, and therefore
      marriageable. She alone sufficed to attract him to the house, and he was
      greatly distressed by the dangerous state of abandonment in which he found
      her.

      Her father continued dragging out his worthless life away from home. Her
      mother, Valentine, had just emerged from a frightful crisis, her final
      rupture with Santerre, who had made up his mind to marry a very wealthy
      old lady, which, after all, was the logical destiny of such a crafty
      exploiter of women, one who behind his affectation of cultured pessimism
      had the vilest and greediest of natures. Valentine, distracted by this
      rupture, had now thrown herself into religion, and, like her husband,
      disappeared from the house for whole days. She was said to be an active
      helpmate of old Count de Navarede, the president of a society of Catholic
      propaganda. Gaston, her son, having left Saint-Cyr three months
      previously, was now at the Cavalry School of Saumur, so fired with passion
      for a military career that he already spoke of remaining a bachelor, since
      a soldier&rsquo;s sword should be his only love, his only spouse. Then Lucie,
      now nineteen years old, and full of mystical exaltation, had already
      entered an Ursuline convent for her novitiate. And in the big empty home,
      whence father, mother, brother and sister fled, there remained but the
      gentle and adorable Andree, exposed to all the blasts of insanity which
      even now swept through the household, and so distressed by loneliness,
      that her uncle, Du Hordel, full of compassionate affection, conceived the
      idea of giving her a husband in the person of young Ambroise, the future
      conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan was helped on by the renewed presence of Celeste the maid. Eight
      years had elapsed since Valentine had been obliged to dismiss this woman
      for immorality; and during those eight years Celeste, weary of service,
      had tried a number of equivocal callings of which she did not speak. She
      had ended by turning up at Rougemont, her native place, in bad health and
      such a state of wretchedness, that for the sake of a living she went out
      as a charwoman there. Then she gradually recovered her health, and
      accumulated a little stock of clothes, thanks to the protection of the
      village priest, whom she won over by an affectation of extreme piety. It
      was at Rougemont, no doubt, that she planned her return to the Seguins, of
      whose vicissitudes she was informed by La Couteau, the latter having kept
      up her intercourse with Madame Menoux, the little haberdasher of the
      neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, shortly after her rupture with Santerre, one day of furious
      despair, when she had again dismissed all her servants, was surprised by
      the arrival of Celeste, who showed herself so repentant, so devoted, and
      so serious-minded, that her former mistress felt touched. She made her
      weep on reminding her of her faults, and asking her to swear before God
      that she would never repeat them; for Celeste now went to confession and
      partook of the holy communion, and carried with her a certificate from the
      Cure of Rougemont vouching for her deep piety and high morality. This
      certificate acted decisively on Valentine, who, unwilling to remain at
      home, and weary of the troubles of housekeeping, understood what precious
      help she might derive from this woman. On her side Celeste certainly
      relied upon power being surrendered to her. Two months later, by favoring
      Lucie&rsquo;s excessive partiality to religious practices, she had helped her
      into a convent. Gaston showed himself only when he secured a few days&rsquo; 
      leave. And so Andree alone remained at home, impeding by her presence the
      great general pillage that Celeste dreamt of. The maid therefore became a
      most active worker on behalf of her young mistress&rsquo;s marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andree, it should be said, was comprised in Ambroise&rsquo;s universal conquest.
      She had met him at her uncle Du Hordel&rsquo;s house for a year before it
      occurred to the latter to marry them. She was a very gentle girl, a little
      golden-haired sheep, as her mother sometimes said. And that handsome,
      smiling young man, who evinced so much kindness towards her, became the
      subject of her thoughts and hopes whenever she suffered from loneliness
      and abandonment. Thus, when her uncle prudently questioned her, she flung
      herself into his arms, weeping big tears of gratitude and confession.
      Valentine, on being approached, at first manifested some surprise. What, a
      son of the Froments! Those Froments had already taken Chantebled from
      them, and did they now want to take one of their daughters? Then, amid the
      collapse of fortune and household, she could find no reasonable objection
      to urge. She had never been attached to Andree. She accused La Catiche,
      the nurse, of having made the child her own. That gentle, docile,
      emotional little sheep was not a Seguin, she often remarked. Then, while
      feigning to defend the girl, Celeste embittered her mother against her,
      and inspired her with a desire to see the marriage promptly concluded, in
      order that she might free herself from her last cares and live as she
      wished. Thus, after a long chat with Mathieu, who promised his consent, it
      remained only for Du Hordel to assure himself of Seguin&rsquo;s approval before
      an application in due form was made. It was difficult, however, to find
      Seguin in a suitable frame of mind. So weeks were lost, and it became
      necessary to pacify Ambroise, who was very much in love, and was doubtless
      warned by his all-invading genius that this loving and simple girl would
      bring him a kingdom in her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Mathieu was passing along the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, it occurred to
      him to call at the house to ascertain if Seguin had re-appeared there, for
      he had suddenly taken himself off without warning, and had gone, so it was
      believed, to Italy. Then, as Mathieu found himself alone with Celeste, the
      opportunity seemed to him an excellent one to discover La Couteau&rsquo;s
      whereabouts. He asked for news of her, saying that a friend of his was in
      need of a good nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, you are in luck&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; the maid replied; &ldquo;La Couteau is
      to bring a child home to our neighbor, Madame Menoux, this very day. It is
      nearly four o&rsquo;clock now, and that is the time when she promised to come.
      You know Madame Menoux&rsquo;s place, do you not? It is the third shop in the
      first street on the left.&rdquo; Then she apologized for being unable to conduct
      him thither: &ldquo;I am alone,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we still have no news of the master.
      On Wednesdays Madame presides at the meeting of her society, and
      Mademoiselle Andree has just gone out walking with her uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu hastily repaired to Madame Menoux&rsquo;s shop. From a distance he saw
      her standing on the threshold; age had made her thinner than ever; at
      forty she was as slim as a young girl, with a long and pointed face.
      Silent labor consumed her; for twenty years she had been desperately
      selling bits of cotton and packages of needles without ever making a
      fortune, but pleased, nevertheless, at being able to add her modest gains
      to her husband&rsquo;s monthly salary in order to provide him with sundry little
      comforts. His rheumatism would no doubt soon compel him to relinquish his
      post as a museum attendant, and how would they be able to manage with his
      pension of a few hundred francs per annum if she did not keep up her
      business? Moreover, they had met with no luck. Their first child had died,
      and some years had elapsed before the birth of a second boy, whom they had
      greeted with delight, no doubt, though he would prove a heavy burden to
      them, especially as they had now decided to take him back from the
      country. Thus Mathieu found the worthy woman in a state of great emotion,
      waiting for the child on the threshold of her shop, and watching the
      corner of the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it was Celeste who sent you, monsieur! No, La Couteau hasn&rsquo;t come
      yet. I&rsquo;m quite astonished at it; I expect her every moment. Will you
      kindly step inside, monsieur, and sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He refused the only chair which blocked up the narrow passage where
      scarcely three customers could have stood in a row. Behind a glass
      partition one perceived the dim back shop, which served as kitchen and
      dining-room and bedchamber, and which received only a little air from a
      damp inner yard which suggested a sewer shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see, monsieur, we have scarcely any room,&rdquo; continued Madame
      Menoux; &ldquo;but then we pay only eight hundred francs rent, and where else
      could we find a shop at that price? And besides, I have been here for
      nearly twenty years, and have worked up a little regular custom in the
      neighborhood. Oh! I don&rsquo;t complain of the place myself, I&rsquo;m not big, there
      is always sufficient room for me. And as my husband comes home only in the
      evening, and then sits down in his armchair to smoke his pipe, he isn&rsquo;t so
      much inconvenienced. I do all I can for him, and he is reasonable enough
      not to ask me to do more. But with a child I fear that it will be
      impossible to get on here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of her first boy, her little Pierre, returned to her, and
      her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, that was ten years ago, and I
      can still see La Couteau bringing him back to me, just as she&rsquo;ll be
      bringing the other by and by. I was told so many tales; there was such
      good air at Rougemont, and the children led such healthy lives, and my boy
      had such rosy cheeks, that I ended by leaving him there till he was five
      years old, regretting that I had no room for him here. And no, you can&rsquo;t
      have an idea of all the presents that the nurse wheedled out of me, of all
      the money that I paid! It was ruination! And then, all at once, I had just
      time to send for the boy, and he was brought back to me as thin and pale
      and weak, as if he had never tasted good bread in his life. Two months
      later he died in my arms. His father fell ill over it, and if we hadn&rsquo;t
      been attached to one another, I think we should both have gone and drowned
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce wiping her eyes she feverishly returned to the threshold, and again
      cast a passionate expectant glance towards the avenue. And when she came
      back, having seen nothing, she resumed: &ldquo;So you will understand our
      emotion when, two years ago, though I was thirty-seven, I again had a
      little boy. We were wild with delight, like a young married couple. But
      what a lot of trouble and worry! We had to put the little fellow out to
      nurse as we let the other one, since we could not possibly keep him here.
      And even after swearing that he should not go to Rougemont we ended by
      saying that we at least knew the place, and that he would not be worse off
      there than elsewhere. Only we sent him to La Vimeux, for we wouldn&rsquo;t hear
      any more of La Loiseau since she sent Pierre back in such a fearful state.
      And this time, as the little fellow is now two years old, I was determined
      to have him home again, though I don&rsquo;t even know where I shall put him.
      I&rsquo;ve been waiting for an hour now, and I can&rsquo;t help trembling, for I
      always fear some catastrophe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not remain in the shop, but remained standing by the doorway,
      with her neck outstretched and her eyes fixed on the street corner. All at
      once a deep cry came from her: &ldquo;Ah! here they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leisurely, and with a sour, harassed air, La Couteau came in and placed
      the sleeping child in Madame Menoux&rsquo;s arms, saying as she did so: &ldquo;Well,
      your George is a tidy weight, I can tell you. You won&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve
      brought you this one back like a skeleton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quivering, her legs sinking beneath her for very joy, the mother had been
      obliged to sit down, keeping her child on her knees, kissing him,
      examining him, all haste to see if he were in good health and likely to
      live. He had a fat and rather pale face, and seemed big, though puffy.
      When she had unfastened his wraps, her hands trembling the while with
      nervousness, she found that he was pot-bellied, with small legs and arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very big about the body,&rdquo; she murmured, ceasing to smile, and
      turning gloomy with renewed fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! complain away!&rdquo; said La Couteau. &ldquo;The other was too thin; this
      one will be too fat. Mothers are never satisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first glance Mathieu had detected that the child was one of those
      who are fed on pap, stuffed for economy&rsquo;s sake with bread and water, and
      fated to all the stomachic complaints of early childhood. And at the sight
      of the poor little fellow, Rougemont, the frightful slaughter-place, with
      its daily massacre of the innocents, arose in his memory, such as it had
      been described to him in years long past. There was La Loiseau, whose
      habits were so abominably filthy that her nurslings rotted as on a manure
      heap; there was La Vimeux, who never purchased a drop of milk, but picked
      up all the village crusts and made bran porridge for her charges as if
      they had been pigs; there was La Gavette too, who, being always in the
      fields, left her nurslings in the charge of a paralytic old man, who
      sometimes let them fall into the fire; and there was La Cauchois, who,
      having nobody to watch the babes, contented herself with tying them in
      their cradles, leaving them in the company of fowls which came in bands to
      peck at their eyes. And the scythe of death swept by; there was wholesale
      assassination; doors were left wide open before rows of cradles, in order
      to make room for fresh bundles despatched from Paris. Yet all did not die;
      here, for instance, was one brought home again. But even when they came
      back alive they carried with them the germs of death, and another hecatomb
      ensued, another sacrifice to the monstrous god of social egotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired out; I must sit down,&rdquo; resumed La Couteau, seating herself on
      the narrow bench behind the counter. &ldquo;Ah! what a trade! And to think that
      we are always received as if we were heartless criminals and thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She also had become withered, her sunburnt, tanned face suggesting more
      than ever the beak of a bird of prey. But her eyes remained very keen,
      sharpened as it were by ferocity. She no doubt failed to get rich fast
      enough, for she continued wailing, complaining of her calling, of the
      increasing avarice of parents, of the demands of the authorities, of the
      warfare which was being declared against nurse-agents on all sides. Yes,
      it was a lost calling, said she, and really God must have abandoned her
      that she should still be compelled to carry it on at forty-five years of
      age. &ldquo;It will end by killing me,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;I shall always get more
      kicks than money at it. How unjust it is! Here have I brought you back a
      superb child, and yet you look anything but pleased&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to
      disgust one of doing one&rsquo;s best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In thus complaining her object perhaps was to extract from the haberdasher
      as large a present as possible. Madame Menoux was certainly disturbed by
      it all. Her boy woke up and began to wail loudly, and it became necessary
      to give him a little lukewarm milk. At last, when the accounts were
      settled, the nurse-agent, seeing that she would have ten francs for
      herself, grew calmer. She was about to take her leave when Madame Menoux,
      pointing to Mathieu, exclaimed: &ldquo;This gentleman wished to speak to you on
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although La Couteau had not seen the gentleman for several years past, she
      had recognized him perfectly well. Still she had not even turned towards
      him, for she knew him to be mixed up in so many matters that his
      discretion was a certainty. And so she contented herself with saying: &ldquo;If
      monsieur will kindly explain to me what it is I shall be quite at his
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany you,&rdquo; replied Mathieu; &ldquo;we can speak together as we walk
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, that will suit me well, for I am rather in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once outside, Mathieu resolved that he would try no ruses with her. The
      best course was to tell her plainly what he wanted, and then to buy her
      silence. At the first words he spoke she understood him. She well
      remembered Norine&rsquo;s child, although in her time she had carried dozens of
      children to the Foundling Hospital. The particular circumstances of that
      case, however, the conversation which had taken place, her drive with
      Mathieu in a cab, had all remained engraved on her memory. Moreover, she
      had found that child again, at Rougemont, five days later; and she even
      remembered that her friend the hospital-attendant had left it with La
      Loiseau. But she had occupied herself no more about it afterwards; and she
      believed that it was now dead, like so many others. When she heard Mathieu
      speak of the hamlet of Saint-Pierre, of Montoir the wheelwright, and of
      Alexandre-Honore, now fifteen, who must be in apprenticeship there, she
      evinced great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must be mistaken, monsieur,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know Montoir at
      Saint-Pierre very well. And he certainly has a lad from the Foundling, of
      the age you mention, at his place. But that lad came from La Cauchois; he
      is a big carroty fellow named Richard, who arrived at our village some
      days before the other. I know who his mother was; she was an English woman
      called Amy, who stopped more than once at Madame Bourdieu&rsquo;s. That
      ginger-haired lad is certainly not your Norine&rsquo;s boy. Alexandre-Honore was
      dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied Mathieu, &ldquo;there must be another apprentice at the
      wheelwright&rsquo;s. My information is precise, it was given me officially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s perplexity La Couteau made a gesture of ignorance, and
      admitted that Mathieu might be right. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;perhaps
      Montoir has two apprentices. He does a good business, and as I haven&rsquo;t
      been to Saint-Pierre for some months now I can say nothing certain. Well,
      and what do you desire of me, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then gave her very clear instructions. She was to obtain the most
      precise information possible about the lad&rsquo;s health, disposition, and
      conduct, whether the schoolmaster had always been pleased with him,
      whether his employer was equally satisfied, and so forth. Briefly, the
      inquiry was to be complete. But, above all things, she was to carry it on
      in such a way that nobody should suspect anything, neither the boy himself
      nor the folks of the district. There must be absolute secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is easy,&rdquo; replied La Couteau, &ldquo;I understand perfectly, and you
      can rely on me. I shall need a little time, however, and the best plan
      will be for me to tell you of the result of my researches when I next come
      to Paris. And if it suits you you will find me to-day fortnight, at two
      o&rsquo;clock, at Broquette&rsquo;s office in the Rue Roquepine. I am quite at home
      there, and the place is like a tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some days later, as Mathieu was again at the Beauchene works with his son
      Blaise, he was observed by Constance, who called him to her and questioned
      him in such direct fashion that he had to tell her what steps he had
      taken. When she heard of his appointment with La Couteau for the Wednesday
      of the ensuing week, she said to him in her resolute way: &ldquo;Come and fetch
      me. I wish to question that woman myself. I want to be quite certain on
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the lapse of fifteen years Broquette&rsquo;s nurse-office in the Rue
      Roquepine had remained the same as formerly, except that Madame Broquette
      was dead and had been succeeded by her daughter Herminie. The sudden loss
      of that fair, dignified lady, who had possessed such a decorative presence
      and so ably represented the high morality and respectability of the
      establishment, had at first seemed a severe one. But it so happened that
      Herminie, a tall, slim, languid creature that she was, gorged with
      novel-reading, also proved in her way a distinguished figurehead for the
      office. She was already thirty and was still unmarried, feeling indeed
      nothing but loathing for all the mothers laden with whining children by
      whom she was surrounded. Moreover, M. Broquette, her father, though now
      more than five-and-seventy, secretly remained the all-powerful, energetic
      director of the place, discharging all needful police duties, drilling new
      nurses like recruits, remaining ever on the watch and incessantly
      perambulating the three floors of his suspicious, dingy lodging-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau was waiting for Mathieu in the doorway. On perceiving
      Constance, whom she did not know, for she had never previously met her,
      she seemed surprised. Who could that lady be? what had she to do with the
      affair? However, she promptly extinguished the bright gleam of curiosity
      which for a moment lighted up her eyes; and as Herminie, with
      distinguished nonchalance, was at that moment exhibiting a party of nurses
      to two gentlemen in the office, she took her visitors into the empty
      refectory, where the atmosphere was as usual tainted by a horrible stench
      of cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, monsieur and madame,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but there is no
      other room free just now. The place is full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she carried her keen glances from Mathieu to Constance, preferring to
      wait until she was questioned, since another person was now in the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can speak out,&rdquo; said Mathieu. &ldquo;Did you make the inquiries I spoke to
      you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur. They were made, and properly made, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell us the result: I repeat that you can speak freely before this
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur, it won&rsquo;t take me long. You were quite right: there were two
      apprentices at the wheelwright&rsquo;s at Saint-Pierre, and one of them was
      Alexandre-Honore, the pretty blonde&rsquo;s child, the same that we took
      together over yonder. He had been there, I found, barely two months, after
      trying three or four other callings, and that explains my ignorance of the
      circumstance. Only he&rsquo;s a lad who can stay nowhere, and so three weeks ago
      he took himself off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance could not restrain an exclamation of anxiety: &ldquo;What! took
      himself off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, I mean that he ran away, and this time it is quite certain
      that he has left the district, for he disappeared with three hundred
      francs belonging to Montoir, his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau&rsquo;s dry voice rang as if it were an axe dealing a deadly blow.
      Although she could not understand the lady&rsquo;s sudden pallor and despairing
      emotion, she certainly seemed to derive cruel enjoyment from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure of your information?&rdquo; resumed Constance, struggling
      against the facts. &ldquo;That is perhaps mere village tittle-tattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tittle-tattle, madame? Oh! when I undertake to do anything I do it
      properly. I spoke to the gendarmes. They have scoured the whole district,
      and it is certain that Alexandre-Honore left no address behind him when he
      went off with those three hundred francs. He is still on the run. As for
      that I&rsquo;ll stake my name on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed a hard blow for Constance. That lad, whom she fancied she
      had found again, of whom she dreamt incessantly, and on whom she had based
      so many unacknowledgable plans of vengeance, escaped her, vanished once
      more into the unknown! She was distracted by it as by some pitiless stroke
      of fate, some fresh and irreparable defeat. However, she continued the
      interrogatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you did not merely see the gendarmes? you were instructed to
      question everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I did, madame. I saw the schoolmaster, and I spoke
      to the other persons who had employed the lad. They all told me that he
      was a good-for-nothing. The schoolmaster remembered that he had been a
      liar and a bully. Now he&rsquo;s a thief; that makes him perfect. I can&rsquo;t say
      otherwise than I have said, since you wanted to know the plain truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau thus emphasized her statements on seeing that the lady&rsquo;s
      suffering increased. And what strange suffering it was; a heart-pang at
      each fresh accusation, as if her husband&rsquo;s illegitimate child had become
      in some degree her own! She ended indeed by silencing the nurse-agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. The boy is no longer at Rougemont, that is all we wished to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Couteau thereupon turned to Mathieu, continuing her narrative, in order
      to give him his money&rsquo;s worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also made the other apprentice talk a bit,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you know, that
      big carroty fellow, Richard, whom I spoke to you about. He&rsquo;s another whom
      I wouldn&rsquo;t willingly trust. But it&rsquo;s certain that he doesn&rsquo;t know where
      his companion has gone. The gendarmes think that Alexandre is in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Mathieu in his turn thanked the woman, and handed her a
      bank-note for fifty francs&mdash;a gift which brought a smile to her face
      and rendered her obsequious, and, as she herself put it, &ldquo;as discreetly
      silent as the grave.&rdquo; Then, as three nurses came into the refectory, and
      Monsieur Broquette could be heard scrubbing another&rsquo;s hands in the
      kitchen, by way of teaching her how to cleanse herself of her native dirt,
      Constance felt nausea arise within her, and made haste to follow her
      companion away. Once in the street, instead of entering the cab which was
      waiting, she paused pensively, haunted by La Couteau&rsquo;s final words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That wretched lad may be in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probable enough; they all end by stranding here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance again hesitated, reflected, and finally made up her mind to say
      in a somewhat tremulous voice: &ldquo;And the mother, my friend; you know where
      she lives, don&rsquo;t you? Did you not tell me that you had concerned yourself
      about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen&mdash;and above all, don&rsquo;t be astonished; pity me, for I am
      really suffering. An idea has just taken possession of me; it seems to me
      that if the boy is in Paris, he may have found his mother. Perhaps he is
      with her, or she may at least know where he lodges. Oh! don&rsquo;t tell me that
      it is impossible. On the contrary, everything is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised and moved at seeing one who usually evinced so much calmness now
      giving way to such fancies as these, Mathieu promised that he would make
      inquiries. Nevertheless, Constance did not get into the cab, but continued
      gazing at the pavement. And when she once more raised her eyes, she spoke
      to him entreatingly, in an embarrassed, humble manner: &ldquo;Do you know what
      we ought to do? Excuse me, but it is a service I shall never forget. If I
      could only know the truth at once it might calm me a little. Well, let us
      drive to that woman&rsquo;s now. Oh! I won&rsquo;t go up; you can go alone, while I
      wait in the cab at the street corner. And perhaps you will obtain some
      news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an insane idea, and he was at first minded to prove this to her.
      Then, on looking at her, she seemed to him so wretched, so painfully
      tortured, that without a word, making indeed but a kindly gesture of
      compassion, he consented. And the cab carried them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large room in which Norine and Cecile lived together was at Grenelle,
      near the Champ de Mars, in a street at the end of the Rue de la
      Federation. They had been there for nearly six years now, and in the
      earlier days had experienced much worry and wretchedness. But the child
      whom they had to feed and save had on his side saved them also. The
      motherly feelings slumbering in Norine&rsquo;s heart had awakened with
      passionate intensity for that poor little one as soon as she had given him
      the breast and learnt to watch over him and kiss him. And it was also
      wondrous to see how that unfortunate creature Cecile regarded the child as
      in some degree her own. He had indeed two mothers, whose thoughts were for
      him alone. If Norine, during the first few months, had often wearied of
      spending her days in pasting little boxes together, if even thoughts of
      flight had at times come to her, she had always been restrained by the
      puny arms that were clasped around her neck. And now she had grown calm,
      sensible, diligent, and very expert at the light work which Cecile had
      taught her. It was a sight to see them both, gay and closely united in
      their little home, which was like a convent cell, spending their days at
      their little table; while between them was their child, their one source
      of life, of hard-working courage and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since they had been living thus they had made but one good friend, and
      this was Madame Angelin. As a delegate of the Poor Relief Service,
      intrusted with one of the Grenelle districts, Madame Angelin had found
      Norine among the pensioners over whom she was appointed to watch. A
      feeling of affection for the two mothers, as she called the sisters, had
      sprung up within her, and she had succeeded in inducing the authorities to
      prolong the child&rsquo;s allowance of thirty francs a month for a period of
      three years. Then she had obtained scholastic assistance for him, not to
      mention frequent presents which she brought&mdash;clothes, linen, and even
      money&mdash;for apart from official matters, charitable people often
      intrusted her with fairly large sums, which she distributed among the most
      meritorious of the poor mothers whom she visited. And even nowadays she
      occasionally called on the sisters, well pleased to spend an hour in that
      nook of quiet toil, which the laughter and the play of the child
      enlivened. She there felt herself to be far away from the world, and
      suffered less from her own misfortunes. And Norine kissed her hands,
      declaring that without her the little household of the two mothers would
      never have managed to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu appeared there, cries of delight arose. He also was a friend,
      a saviour&mdash;the one who, by first taking and furnishing the large
      room, had founded the household. It was a very clean room, almost
      coquettish with its white curtains, and rendered very cheerful by its two
      large windows, which admitted the golden radiance of the afternoon sun.
      Norine and Cecile were working at the table, cutting out cardboard and
      pasting it together, while the little one, who had come home from school,
      sat between them on a high chair, gravely handling a pair of scissors and
      fully persuaded that he was helping them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it you? How kind of you to come to see us! Nobody has called for
      five days past. Oh! we don&rsquo;t complain of it. We are so happy alone
      together! Since Irma married a clerk she has treated us with disdain.
      Euphrasie can no longer come down her stairs. Victor and his wife live so
      far away. And as for that rascal Alfred, he only comes up here to see if
      he can find something to steal. Mamma called five days ago to tell us that
      papa had narrowly escaped being killed at the works on the previous day.
      Poor mamma! she is so worn out that before long she won&rsquo;t be able to take
      a step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the sisters thus rattled on both together, one beginning a sentence
      and the other finishing it, Mathieu looked at Norine, who, thanks to that
      peaceful and regular life, had regained in her thirty-sixth year a
      freshness of complexion that suggested a superb, mature fruit gilded by
      the sun. And even the slender Cecile had acquired strength, the strength
      which love&rsquo;s energy can impart even to a childish form.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, however, she raised a loud exclamation of horror: &ldquo;Oh! he has
      hurt himself, the poor little fellow.&rdquo; And at once she snatched the
      scissors from the child, who sat there laughing with a drop of blood at
      the tip of one of his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good Heavens,&rdquo; murmured Norine, who had turned quite pale, &ldquo;I feared
      that he had slit his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mathieu wondered if he would serve any useful purpose by
      fulfilling the strange mission he had undertaken. Then it seemed to him
      that it might be as well to say at least a word of warning to the young
      woman who had grown so calm and quiet, thanks to the life of work which
      she had at last embraced. And he proceeded very prudently, only revealing
      the truth by slow degrees. Nevertheless, there came a moment when, after
      reminding Norine of the birth of Alexandre-Honore, it became necessary for
      him to add that the boy was living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother looked at Mathieu in evident consternation. &ldquo;He is living,
      living! Why do you tell me that? I was so pleased at knowing nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; but it is best that you should know. I have even been assured
      that he must now be in Paris, and I wondered whether he might have found
      you, and have come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this she lost all self-possession. &ldquo;What! Have come to see me! Nobody
      has been to see me. Do you think, then, that he might come? But I don&rsquo;t
      want him to do so! I should go mad! A big fellow of fifteen falling on me
      like that&mdash;a lad I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t care for! Oh! no, no; prevent
      it, I beg of you; I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of utter distraction she had burst into tears, and had
      caught hold of the little one near her, pressing him to her breast as if
      to shield him from the other, the unknown son, the stranger, who by his
      resurrection threatened to thrust himself in some degree in the younger
      lad&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have but one child; there is only one I love; I
      don&rsquo;t want any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecile had risen, greatly moved, and desirous of bringing her sister to
      reason. Supposing that the other son should come, how could she turn him
      out of doors? At the same time, though her pity was aroused for the
      abandoned one, she also began to bewail the loss of their happiness. It
      became necessary for Mathieu to reassure them both by saying that he
      regarded such a visit as most improbable. Without telling them the exact
      truth, he spoke of the elder lad&rsquo;s disappearance, adding, however, that he
      must be ignorant even of his mother&rsquo;s name. Thus, when he left the
      sisters, they already felt relieved and had again turned to their little
      boxes while smiling at their son, to whom they had once more intrusted the
      scissors in order that he might cut out some paper men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down below, at the street corner, Constance, in great impatience, was
      looking out of the cab window, watching the house-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, quivering, as soon as Mathieu was near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the mother knows nothing and has seen nobody. It was a foregone
      conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank down as if from some supreme collapse, and her ashen face became
      quite distorted. &ldquo;You are right, it was certain,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;still one
      always hopes.&rdquo; And with a gesture of despair she added: &ldquo;It is all ended
      now. Everything fails me, my last dream is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu pressed her hand and remained waiting for her to give an address
      in order that he might transmit it to the driver. But she seemed to have
      lost her head and to have forgotten where she wished to go. Then, as she
      asked him if he would like her to set him down anywhere, he replied that
      he wished to call on the Seguins. The fear of finding herself alone again
      so soon after the blow which had fallen on her thereupon gave her the idea
      of paying a visit to Valentine, whom she had not seen for some time past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; she said to Mathieu; &ldquo;we will go to the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vehicle rolled off and heavy silence fell between them; they had not a
      word to say to one another. However, as they were reaching their
      destination, Constance exclaimed in a bitter voice: &ldquo;You must give my
      husband the good news, and tell him that the boy has disappeared. Ah! what
      a relief for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, on calling in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, had hoped to find the Seguins
      assembled there. Seguin himself had returned to Paris, nobody knew whence,
      a week previously, when Andree&rsquo;s hand had been formally asked of him; and
      after an interview with his uncle Du Hordel he had evinced great
      willingness and cordiality. Indeed, the wedding had immediately been fixed
      for the month of May, when the Froments also hoped to marry off their
      daughter Rose. The two weddings, it was thought, might take place at
      Chantebled on the same day, which would be delightful. This being
      arranged, Ambroise was accepted as fiance, and to his great delight was
      able to call at the Seguins&rsquo; every day, about five o&rsquo;clock, to pay his
      court according to established usage. It was on account of this that
      Mathieu fully expected to find the whole family at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Constance asked for Valentine, however, a footman informed her that
      Madame had gone out. And when Mathieu in his turn asked for Seguin, the
      man replied that Monsieur was also absent. Only Mademoiselle was at home
      with her betrothed. On learning this the visitors went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you left all alone?&rdquo; exclaimed Mathieu on perceiving the young
      couple seated side by side on a little couch in the big room on the first
      floor, which Seguin had once called his &ldquo;cabinet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, we are alone in the house,&rdquo; Andree answered with a charming
      laugh. &ldquo;We are very pleased at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked adorable, thus seated side by side&mdash;she so gentle, of
      such tender beauty&mdash;he with all the fascinating charm that was
      blended with his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Celeste there at any rate?&rdquo; again inquired Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she has disappeared we don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo; And again they laughed like
      free frolicsome birds ensconced in the depths of some lonely forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you cannot be very lively all alone like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we don&rsquo;t feel at all bored, we have so many things to talk about. And
      then we look at one another. And there is never an end to it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though her heart bled, Constance could not help admiring them. Ah, to
      think of it! Such grace, such health, such hope! While in her home all was
      blighted, withered, destroyed, that race of Froments seemed destined to
      increase forever! For this again was a conquest&mdash;those two children
      left free to love one another, henceforth alone in that sumptuous mansion
      which to-morrow would belong to them. Then, at another thought, Constance
      turned towards Mathieu: &ldquo;Are you not also marrying your eldest daughter?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rose,&rdquo; Mathieu gayly responded. &ldquo;We shall have a grand fete at
      Chantebled next May! You must all of you come there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twas indeed as she had thought: numbers prevailed, life proved
      victorious. Chantebled had been conquered from the Seguins, and now their
      very house would soon be invaded by Ambroise, while the Beauchene works
      themselves had already half fallen into the hands of Blaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go,&rdquo; she answered, quivering. &ldquo;And may your good luck continue&mdash;that
      is what I wish you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      AMID the general delight attending the double wedding which was to prove,
      so to say, a supreme celebration of the glory of Chantebled, it had
      occurred to Mathieu&rsquo;s daughter Rose to gather the whole family together
      one Sunday, ten days before the date appointed for the ceremony. She and
      her betrothed, followed by the whole family, were to repair to Janville
      station in the morning to meet the other affianced pair, Ambroise and
      Andree, who were to be conducted in triumph to the farm where they would
      all lunch together. It would be a kind of wedding rehearsal, she exclaimed
      with her hearty laugh; they would be able to arrange the programme for the
      great day. And her idea enraptured her to such a point, she seemed to
      anticipate so much delight from this preliminary festival, that Mathieu
      and Marianne consented to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose&rsquo;s marriage was like the supreme blossoming of years of prosperity,
      and brought a finishing touch to the happiness of the home. She was the
      prettiest of Mathieu&rsquo;s daughters, with dark brown hair, round gilded
      cheeks, merry eyes, and charming mouth. And she had the most equable of
      dispositions, her laughter ever rang out so heartily! She seemed indeed to
      be the very soul, the good fairy, of that farm teeming with busy life. But
      beneath the invariable good humor which kept her singing from morning till
      night there was much common sense and energy of affection, as her choice
      of a husband showed. Eight years previously Mathieu had engaged the
      services of one Frederic Berthaud, the son of a petty farmer of the
      neighborhood. This sturdy young fellow had taken a passionate interest in
      the creative work of Chantebled, learning and working there with rare
      activity and intelligence. He had no means of his own at all. Rose, who
      had grown up near him, knew however that he was her father&rsquo;s preferred
      assistant, and when he returned to the farm at the expiration of his
      military service she, divining that he loved her, forced him to
      acknowledge it. Thus she settled her own future life; she wished to remain
      near her parents, on that farm which had hitherto held all her happiness.
      Neither Mathieu nor Marianne was surprised at this. Deeply touched, they
      signified their approval of a choice in which affection for themselves had
      so large a part. The family ties seemed to be drawn yet closer, and
      increase of joy came to the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      So everything was settled, and it was agreed that on the appointed Sunday
      Ambroise should bring his betrothed Andree and her mother, Madame Seguin,
      to Janville by the ten o&rsquo;clock train. A couple of hours previously Rose
      had already begun a battle with the object of prevailing upon the whole
      family to repair to the railway station to meet the affianced pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come, my children, it is unreasonable,&rdquo; Marianne gently exclaimed.
      &ldquo;It is necessary that somebody should stay at home. I shall keep Nicolas
      here, for there is no need to send children of five years old scouring the
      roads. I shall also keep Gervais and Claire. But you may take all the
      others if you like, and your father shall lead the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose, however, still merrily laughing, clung to her plan. &ldquo;No, no, mamma,
      you must come as well; everybody must come; it was promised. Ambroise and
      Andree, you see, are like a royal couple from a neighboring kingdom. My
      brother Ambroise, having won the hand of a foreign princess, is going to
      present her to us. And so, to do them the honors of our own empire, we,
      Frederic and I, must go to meet them, attended by the whole Court. You
      form the Court and you cannot do otherwise than come. Ah what a fine sight
      it will be when we spread out through the country on our way home again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, amused by her daughter&rsquo;s overflowing gayety, ended by laughing
      and giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be the order of the march,&rdquo; resumed Rose. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve planned
      everything, as you will see! As for Frederic and myself, we shall go on
      our bicycles&mdash;that is the most modern style. We will also take my
      maids of honor, my little sisters Louise, Madeleine, and Marguerite,
      eleven, nine, and seven years old, on their bicycles. They will look very
      well behind me. Then Gregoire can follow on his wheel; he is thirteen, and
      will do as a page, bringing up the rear of my personal escort. All the
      rest of the Court will have to pack itself into the chariot&mdash;I mean
      the big family wagon, in which there is room for eight. You, as Queen
      Mother, may keep your last little prince, Nicolas, on your knees. Papa
      will only have to carry himself proudly, as befits the head of a dynasty.
      And my brother Gervais, that young Hercules of seventeen, shall drive,
      with Claire, who at fifteen is so remarkable for common sense, beside him
      on the box-seat. As for the illustrious twins, those high and mighty
      lords, Denis and Blaise, we will call for them at Janville, since they are
      waiting for us there, at Madame Desvignes&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Rose rattle on, exulting over the scheme she had devised. She
      danced, sang, clapped her hands, and finally exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah! for a pretty
      cortege this will be fine indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was animated by such joyous haste that she made the party start much
      sooner than was necessary, and they reached Janville at half-past nine. It
      was true, however, that they had to call for the others there. The house
      in which Madame Desvignes had taken refuge after her husband&rsquo;s death, and
      which she had now occupied for some twelve years, living there in a very
      quiet retired way on the scanty income she had managed to save, was the
      first in the village, on the high road. For a week past her elder daughter
      Charlotte, Blaise&rsquo;s wife, had come to stay there with her children, Berthe
      and Christophe, who needed change of air; and on the previous evening they
      had been joined by Blaise, who was well pleased to spend Sunday with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvignes&rsquo; younger daughter, Marthe, was delighted whenever her
      sister thus came to spend a few weeks in the old home, bringing her little
      ones with her, and once more occupying the room which had belonged to her
      in her girlish days. All the laughter and playfulness of the past came
      back again, and the one dream of worthy Madame Desvignes, amid her pride
      at being a grandmamma, was of completing her life-work, hitherto so
      prudently carried on, by marrying off Marthe in her turn. As a matter of
      fact it had seemed likely that there might be three instead of two
      weddings at Chantebled that spring. Denis, who, since leaving a scientific
      school had embarked in fresh technical studies, often slept at the farm
      and nearly every Sunday he saw Marthe, who was of the same age as Rose and
      her constant companion. The young girl, a pretty blonde like her sister
      Charlotte, but of a less impulsive and more practical nature, had indeed
      attracted Denis, and, dowerless though she was, he had made up his mind to
      marry her, since he had discovered that she possessed the sterling
      qualities that help one on to fortune. But in their chats together both
      evinced good sense and serene confidence, without sign of undue haste.
      Particularly was this the case with Denis, who was very methodical in his
      ways and unwilling to place a woman&rsquo;s happiness in question until he could
      offer her an assured position. Thus, of their own accord, they had
      postponed their marriage, quietly and smilingly resisting the passionate
      assaults of Rose, whom the idea of three weddings on the same day had
      greatly excited. At the same time, Denis continued visiting Madame
      Desvignes, who, on her side, equally prudent and confident, received him
      much as if he were her son. That morning he had even quitted the farm at
      seven o&rsquo;clock, saying that he meant to surprise Blaise in bed; and thus he
      also was to be met at Janville.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, the fete of Janville fell on Sunday, the second in May.
      Encompassing the square in front of the railway station were roundabouts,
      booths, shooting galleries, and refreshment stalls. Stormy showers during
      the night had cleansed the sky, which was of a pure blue, with a flaming
      sun, whose heat in fact was excessive for the season. A good many people
      were already assembled on the square&mdash;all the idlers of the district,
      bands of children, and peasants of the surrounding country, eager to see
      the sights; and into the midst of this crowd fell the Froments&mdash;first
      the bicyclists, next the wagon, and then the others who had been met at
      the entry of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are producing our little effect!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose as she sprang from
      her wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was incontestable. During the earlier years the whole of Janville had
      looked harshly on those Froments, those bourgeois who had come nobody knew
      whence, and who, with overweening conceit, had talked of making corn grow
      in land where there had been nothing but crops of stones for centuries
      past. Then the miracle, Mathieu&rsquo;s extraordinary victory, had long hurt
      people&rsquo;s vanity and thereby increased their anger. But everything passes
      away; one cannot regard success with rancor, and folks who grow rich
      always end by being in the right. Thus, nowadays, Janville smiled
      complacently on that swarming family which had grown up beside it,
      forgetting that in former times each fresh birth at Chantebled had been
      regarded as quite scandalous by the gossips. Besides, how could one resist
      such a happy display of strength and power, such a merry invasion, when,
      as on that festive Sunday, the whole family came up at a gallop,
      conquering the roads, the streets, and the squares? What with the father
      and mother, the eleven children&mdash;six boys and five girls&mdash;and
      two grandchildren already, there were fifteen of them. The eldest boys,
      the twins, were now four-and twenty, and still so much alike that people
      occasionally mistook one for the other as in their cradle days, when
      Marianne had been obliged to open their eyes to identify them, those of
      Blaise being gray, and those of Denis black. Nicolas, the youngest boy, at
      the other end of the family scale, was as yet but five years old; a
      delightful little urchin was he, a precocious little man whose energy and
      courage were quite amusing. And between the twins and that youngster came
      the eight other children: Ambroise, the future husband, who was already on
      the road to every conquest; Rose, so brimful of life; who likewise was on
      the eve of marrying; Gervais, with his square brow and wrestler&rsquo;s limbs,
      who would soon be fighting the good fight of agriculture; Claire, who was
      silent and hardworking, and lacked beauty, but possessed a strong heart
      and a housewife&rsquo;s sensible head. Next Gregoire, the undisciplined,
      self-willed schoolboy, who was ever beating the hedges in search of
      adventures; and then the three last girls: Louise, plump and good natured;
      Madeleine, delicate and of dreamy mind; Marguerite, the least pretty but
      the most loving of the trio. And when, behind their father and their
      mother, the eleven came along one after the other, followed too by Berthe
      and Christophe, representing yet another generation, it was a real
      procession that one saw, as, for instance, on that fine Sunday on the
      Grand Place of Janville, already crowded with holiday-making folks. And
      the effect was irresistible; even those who were scarcely pleased with the
      prodigious success of Chantebled felt enlivened and amused at seeing the
      Froments galloping about and invading the place. So much health and mirth
      and strength accompanied them, as if earth with her overflowing gifts of
      life had thus profusely created them for to-morrow&rsquo;s everlasting hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let those who think themselves more numerous come forward!&rdquo; Rose resumed
      gayly. &ldquo;And then we will count one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, be quiet!&rdquo; said her mother, who, after alighting from the wagon,
      had set Nicolas on the ground. &ldquo;You will end by making people hoot us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot us! Why, they admire us: just look at them! How funny it is, mamma,
      that you are not prouder of yourself and of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am so very proud that I fear to humiliate others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all began to laugh. And Mathieu, standing near Marianne, likewise
      felt proud at finding himself, as he put it, among &ldquo;the sacred battalion&rdquo;
       of his sons and daughters. To that battalion worthy Madame Desvignes
      herself belonged, since her daughter Charlotte was adding soldiers to it
      and helping it to become an army. Such as it was indeed, this was only the
      beginning; later on the battalion would be seen ever increasing and
      multiplying, becoming a swarming victorious race, great-grandchildren
      following grandchildren, till there were fifty of them, and a hundred, and
      two hundred, all tending to increase the happiness and beauty of the
      world. And in the mingled amazement and amusement of Janville gathered
      around that fruitful family there was certainly some of the instinctive
      admiration which is felt for the strength and the healthfulness which
      create great nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, we have only friends now,&rdquo; remarked Mathieu. &ldquo;Everybody is
      cordial with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everybody!&rdquo; muttered Rose. &ldquo;Just look at the Lepailleurs yonder, in
      front of that booth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lepailleurs were indeed there&mdash;the father, the mother, Antonin,
      and Therese. In order to avoid the Froments they were pretending to take
      great interest in a booth, where a number of crudely-colored china
      ornaments were displayed as prizes for the winners at a &ldquo;lucky-wheel.&rdquo;
       They no longer even exchanged courtesies with the Chantebled folks; for in
      their impotent rage at such ceaseless prosperity they had availed
      themselves of a petty business dispute to break off all relations.
      Lepailleur regarded the creation of Chantebled as a personal insult, for
      he had not forgotten his jeers and challenges with respect to those
      moorlands, from which, in his opinion, one would never reap anything but
      stones. And thus, when he had well examined the china ornaments, it
      occurred to him to be insolent, with which object he turned round and
      stared at the Froments, who, as the train they were expecting would not
      arrive for another quarter of an hour, were gayly promenading through the
      fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller&rsquo;s bad temper had for the last two months been increased by the
      return of his son Antonin to Janville under very deplorable circumstances.
      This young fellow, who had set off one morning to conquer Paris, sent
      there by his parents, who had a blind confidence in his fine handwriting,
      had remained with Maitre Rousselet the attorney for four years as a petty
      clerk, dull-witted and extremely idle. He had not made the slightest
      progress in his profession, but had gradually sunk into debauchery,
      cafe-life, drunkenness, gambling, and facile amours. To him the conquest
      of Paris meant greedy indulgence in the coarsest pleasures such as he had
      dreamt of in his village. It consumed all his money, all the supplies
      which he extracted from his mother by continual promises of victory, in
      which she implicitly believed, so great was her faith in him. But he ended
      by grievously suffering in health, turned thin and yellow, and actually
      began to lose his hair at three-and-twenty, so that his mother, full of
      alarm, brought him home one day, declaring that he worked too hard, and
      that she would not allow him to kill himself in that fashion. It leaked
      out, however, later on, that Maitre Rousselet had summarily dismissed him.
      Even before this was known his return home did not fail to make his father
      growl. The miller partially guessed the truth, and if he did not openly
      vent his anger, it was solely from pride, in order that he might not have
      to confess his mistake with respect to the brilliant career which he had
      predicted for Antonin. At home, when the doors were closed, Lepailleur
      revenged himself on his wife, picking the most frightful quarrels with her
      since he had discovered her frequent remittances of money to their son.
      But she held her own against him, for even as she had formerly admired
      him, so at present she admired her boy. She sacrificed, as it were, the
      father to the son, now that the latter&rsquo;s greater learning brought her
      increased surprise. And so the household was all disagreement as a result
      of that foolish attempt, born of vanity, to make their heir a Monsieur, a
      Parisian. Antonin for his part sneered and shrugged his shoulders at it
      all, idling away his time pending the day when he might be able to resume
      a life of profligacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Froments passed by, it was a fine sight to see the Lepailleurs
      standing there stiffly and devouring them with their eyes. The father
      puckered his lips in an attempt to sneer, and the mother jerked her head
      with an air of bravado. The son, standing there with his hands in his
      pockets, presented a sorry sight with his bent back, his bald head, and
      pale face. All three were seeking to devise something disagreeable when an
      opportunity presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is Therese?&rdquo; exclaimed La Lepailleur. &ldquo;She was here just now:
      what has become of her? I won&rsquo;t have her leave me when there are all these
      people about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite true, for the last moment Therese had disappeared. She was
      now ten years old and very pretty, quite a plump little blonde, with wild
      hair and black eyes which shone brightly. But she had a terribly impulsive
      and wilful nature, and would run off and disappear for hours at a time,
      beating the hedges and scouring the countryside in search of birds&rsquo;-nests
      and flowers and wild fruit. If her mother, however, made such a display of
      alarm, darting hither and thither to find her, just as the Froments passed
      by, it was because she had become aware of some scandalous proceedings
      during the previous week. Therese&rsquo;s ardent dream was to possess a bicycle,
      and she desired one the more since her parents stubbornly refused to
      content her, declaring in fact that those machines might do for bourgeois
      but were certainly not fit for well-behaved girls. Well, one afternoon,
      when she had gone as usual into the fields, her mother, returning from
      market, had perceived her on a deserted strip of road, in company with
      little Gregoire Froment, another young wanderer whom she often met in this
      wise, in spots known only to themselves. The two made a very suitable
      pair, and were ever larking and rambling along the paths, under the
      leaves, beside the ditches. But the abominable thing was that, on this
      occasion, Gregoire, having seated Therese on his own bicycle, was
      supporting her at the waist and running alongside, helping her to direct
      the machine. Briefly it was a real bicycle lesson which the little rascal
      was giving, and which the little hussy took with all the pleasure in the
      world. When Therese returned home that evening she had her ears soundly
      boxed for her pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can that little gadabout have got to?&rdquo; La Lepailleur continued
      shouting. &ldquo;One can no sooner take one&rsquo;s eyes off her than she runs away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antonin, however, having peeped behind the booth containing the china
      ornaments, lurched back again, still with his hands in his pockets, and
      said with his vicious sneer: &ldquo;Just look there, you&rsquo;ll see something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, behind the booth, his mother again found Therese and Gregoire
      together. The lad was holding his bicycle with one hand and explaining
      some of the mechanism of it, while the girl, full of admiration and
      covetousness, looked on with glowing eyes. Indeed she could not resist her
      inclination, but laughingly let Gregoire raise her in order to seat her
      for a moment on the saddle, when all at once her mother&rsquo;s terrible voice
      burst forth: &ldquo;You wicked hussy! what are you up to there again? Just come
      back at once, or I&rsquo;ll settle your business for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu also, catching sight of the scene, sternly summoned Gregoire:
      &ldquo;Please to place your wheel with the others. You know what I have already
      said to you, so don&rsquo;t begin again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was war. Lepailleur impudently growled ignoble threats, which
      fortunately were lost amid the strains of a barrel organ. And the two
      families separated, going off in different directions through the growing
      holiday-making crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that train ever come, then?&rdquo; resumed Rose, who with joyous
      impatience was at every moment turning to glance at the clock of the
      little railway station on the other side of the square. &ldquo;We have still ten
      minutes to wait: whatever shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened she had stopped in front of a hawker who stood on the
      footway with a basketful of crawfish, crawling, pell-mell, at his feet.
      They had certainly come from the sources of the Yeuse, three leagues away.
      They were not large, but they were very tasty, for Rose herself had
      occasionally caught some in the stream. And thus a greedy but also playful
      fancy came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;let us buy the whole basketful. It will be for
      the feast of welcome, you see; it will be our present to the royal couple
      we are awaiting. People won&rsquo;t say that Our Majesties neglect to do things
      properly when they are expecting other Majesties. And I will cook them
      when we get back, and you&rsquo;ll see how well I shall succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the others began to poke fun at her, but her parents ended by
      doing as she asked, big child as she was, who in the fulness of her
      happiness hardly knew what amusement to seek. However, as by way of
      pastime she obstinately sought to count the crawfish, quite an affair
      ensued: some of them pinched her, and she dropped them with a little
      shriek; and, amid it all, the basket fell over and then the crawfish
      hurriedly crawled away. The boys and girls darted in pursuit of them,
      there was quite a hunt, in which even the serious members of the family at
      last took part. And what with the laughter and eagerness of one and all,
      the big as well as the little, the whole happy brood, the sight was so
      droll and gay that the folks of Janville again drew near and
      good-naturedly took their share of the amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, however, arose a distant rumble of wheels and an engine
      whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good Heavens! here they are!&rdquo; cried Rose, quite scared; &ldquo;quick,
      quick, or the reception will be missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A scramble ensued, the owner of the crawfish was paid, and there was just
      time to shut the basket and carry it to the wagon. The whole family was
      already running off, invading the little station, and ranging itself in
      good order along the arrival platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not like that,&rdquo; Rose repeated. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t observe the right order
      of precedence. The queen mother must be with the king her husband, and
      then the princes according to their height. Frederic must place himself on
      my right. And it&rsquo;s for me, you know, to make the speech of welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train stopped. When Ambroise and Andree alighted they were at first
      much surprised to find that everybody had come to meet them, drawn up in a
      row with solemn mien. When Rose, however began to deliver a pompous little
      speech, treating her brother&rsquo;s betrothed like some foreign princess, whom
      she had orders to welcome in the name of the king, her father, the young
      couple began to laugh, and even prolonged the joke by responding in the
      same style. The railway men looked on and listened, gaping. It was a fine
      farce, and the Froments were delighted at showing themselves so playful on
      that warm May morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marianne suddenly raised an exclamation of surprise: &ldquo;What! has not
      Madame Seguin come with you? She gave me so many promises that she would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the rear of Ambroise and Andree Celeste the maid had alone alighted
      from the train. And she undertook to explain things: &ldquo;Madame charged me,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;to say that she was really most grieved. Yesterday she still
      hoped that she would be able to keep her promise. Only in the evening she
      received a visit from Monsieur de Navarede, who is presiding to-day,
      Sunday, at a meeting of his Society, and of course Madame could not do
      otherwise than attend it. So she requested me to accompany the young
      people, and everything is satisfactory, for here they are, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact nobody regretted the absence of Valentine, who always
      moped when she came into the country. And Mathieu expressed the general
      opinion in a few words of polite regret: &ldquo;Well, you must tell her how much
      we shall miss her. And now let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celeste, however, intervened once more. &ldquo;Excuse me, monsieur, but I cannot
      remain with you. No. Madame particularly told me to go back to her at
      once, as she will need me to dress her. And, besides, she is always bored
      when she is alone. There is a train for Paris at a quarter past ten, is
      there not? I will go back by it. Then I will be here at eight o&rsquo;clock this
      evening to take Mademoiselle home. We settled all that in looking through
      a time-table. Till this evening, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till this evening, then, it&rsquo;s understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, leaving the maid in the deserted little station, all the others
      returned to the village square, where the wagon and the bicycles were
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we are all assembled,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose, &ldquo;and the real fete is about to
      begin. Let me organize the procession for our triumphal return to the
      castle of our ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much afraid that your procession will be soaked,&rdquo; said
      Marianne. &ldquo;Just look at the rain approaching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the last few moments there had appeared in the hitherto spotless
      sky a huge, livid cloud, rising from the west and urged along by a sudden
      squall. It presaged a return of the violent stormy showers of the previous
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain! Oh, we don&rsquo;t care about that,&rdquo; the girl responded with an air of
      superb defiance. &ldquo;It will never dare to come down before we get home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a comical semblance of authority, she disposed her people in
      the order which she had planned in her mind a week previously. And the
      procession set off through the admiring village, amid the smiles of all
      the good women hastening to their doorsteps, and then spread out along the
      white road between the fertile fields, where bands of startled larks took
      wing, carrying their clear song to the heavens. It was really magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the party were Rose and Frederic, side by side on their
      bicycles, opening the nuptial march with majestic amplitude. Behind them
      followed the three maids of honor, the younger sisters, Louise, Madeleine,
      and Marguerite, the tallest first, the shortest last, and each on a wheel
      proportioned to her growth. And with berets* on their heads, and their
      hair down their backs, waving in the breeze, they looked adorable,
      suggesting a flight of messenger swallows skimming over the ground and
      bearing good tidings onward. As for Gregoire the page, restive and always
      ready to bolt, he did not behave very well; for he actually tried to pass
      the royal couple at the head of the procession, a proceeding which brought
      him various severe admonitions until he fell back, as duty demanded, to
      his deferential and modest post. On the other hand, as the three maids of
      honor began to sing the ballad of Cinderella on her way to the palace of
      Prince Charming, the royal couple condescendingly declared that the song
      was appropriate and of pleasing effect, whatever might be the requirements
      of etiquette. Indeed, Rose, Frederic, and Gregoire also ended by singing
      the ballad, which rang out amid the serene, far-spreading countryside like
      the finest music in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, at a short distance in the rear, came the chariot, the good old
      family wagon, which was now crowded. According to the prearranged
      programme it was Gervais who held the ribbons, with Claire beside him. The
      two strong horses trotted on in their usual leisurely fashion, in spite of
      all the gay whip-cracking of their driver, who also wished to contribute
      to the music. Inside there were now seven people for six places, for if
      the three children were small, they were at the same time so restless that
      they fully took up their share of room. First, face to face, there were
      Ambroise and Andree, the betrothed couple who were being honored by this
      glorious welcome. Then, also face to face, there were the high and mighty
      rulers of the region, Mathieu and Marianne, the latter of whom kept little
      Nicolas, the last prince of the line, on her knees, he braying the while
      like a little donkey, because he felt so pleased. Then the last places
      were occupied by the rulers&rsquo; granddaughter and grandson, Mademoiselle
      Berthe and Monsieur Christophe, who were as yet unable to walk long
      distances. And the chariot rolled on with much majesty, albeit that for
      fear of the rain the curtains of stout white linen had already been
      half-drawn, thus giving the vehicle, at a distance, somewhat of the aspect
      of a miller&rsquo;s van.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further back yet, as a sort of rear-guard, was a group on foot, composed
      of Blaise, Denis, Madame Desvignes, and her daughters Charlotte and
      Marthe. They had absolutely refused to take a fly, finding it more
      pleasant to walk the mile and a half which separated Chantebled from
      Janville. If the rain should fall, they would manage to find shelter
      somewhere. Besides, Rose had declared that a suite on foot was absolutely
      necessary to give the procession its full significance. Those five last
      comers would represent the multitude, the great concourse of people which
      follows sovereigns and acclaims them. Or else they might be the necessary
      guard, the men-at-arms, who watched for the purpose of foiling a possible
      attack from some felon neighbor. At the same time it unfortunately
      happened that worthy Madame Desvignes could not walk very fast, so that
      the rear-guard was soon distanced, to such a degree indeed that it became
      merely a little lost group, far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still this did not disconcert Rose, but rather made her laugh the more. At
      the first bend of the road she turned her head, and when she saw her
      rear-guard more than three hundred yards away she raised cries of
      admiration. &ldquo;Oh! just look, Frederic! What an interminable procession!
      What a deal of room we take up! The cortege is becoming longer and longer,
      and the road won&rsquo;t be long enough for it very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the three maids of honor and the page began to jeer
      impertinently, &ldquo;just try to be respectful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Count a little.
      There are six of us forming the vanguard. In the chariot there are nine,
      and six and nine make fifteen. Add to them the five of the rear-guard, and
      we have twenty. Wherever else is such a family seen? Why, the rabbits who
      watch us pass are mute with stupor and humiliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came another laugh, and once more they all took up the song of
      Cinderella on her way to the palace of Prince Charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the bridge over the Yeuse that the first drops of rain, big
      drops they were, began to fall. The big livid cloud, urged on by a
      terrible wind, was galloping across the sky, filling it with the clamor of
      a tempest. And almost immediately afterwards the rain-drops increased in
      volume and in number, lashed by so violent a squall that the water poured
      down as if by the bucketful, or as if some huge sluice-gate had suddenly
      burst asunder overhead. One could no longer see twenty yards before one.
      In two minutes the road was running with water like the bed of a torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a <i>sauve-qui-peut</i> among the procession. It was learnt
      later on that the people of the rear-guard had luckily been surprised near
      a peasant&rsquo;s cottage, in which they had quietly sought refuge. Then the
      folks in the wagon simply drew their curtains, and halted beneath the
      shelter of a wayside tree for fear lest the horses should take fright
      under such a downpour. They called to the bicyclists ahead of them to stop
      also, instead of obstinately remaining in such a deluge. But their words
      were lost amid the rush of water. However, the little girls and the page
      took a proper course in crouching beside a thick hedge, though the
      betrothed couple wildly continued on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, the more reasonable of the two, certainly had sense enough to
      say: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t prudent on our part. Let us stop like the others, I beg
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But from Rose, all excitement, transported by her blissful fever, and
      insensible, so it seemed, to the pelting of the rain, he only drew this
      answer: &ldquo;Pooh! what does it matter, now that we are soaking? It is by
      stopping that we might do ourselves harm. Let us make haste, all haste. In
      three minutes we shall be at home and able to make fine sport of those
      laggards when they arrive in another quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had just crossed the Yeuse bridge, and they swept on side by side,
      although the road was far from easy, being a continual ascent for a
      thousand yards or so between rows of lofty poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that we are doing wrong,&rdquo; the young man repeated. &ldquo;They will
      blame me, and they will be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m amusing myself. This bicycle bath is quite
      funny. Leave me, then, if you don&rsquo;t love me enough to follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her, however, pressed close beside her, and sought to shelter
      her a little from the slanting rain. And it was a wild, mad race on the
      part of that young couple, almost linked together, their elbows touching
      as they sped on and on, as if lifted from the ground, carried off by all
      that rushing, howling water which poured down so ragefully. It was as
      though a thunder-blast bore them along. But at the very moment when they
      sprang from their bicycles in the yard of the farm the rain ceased, and
      the sky became blue once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was laughing like a lunatic, and looked very flushed, but she was
      soaked to such a point that water streamed from her clothes, her hair, her
      hands. You might have taken her for some fairy of the springs who had
      overturned her urn on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fete is complete,&rdquo; she exclaimed breathlessly. &ldquo;All the same,
      we are the first home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then darted upstairs to comb her hair and change her gown. But to gain
      just a few minutes, eager as she was to cook the crawfish, she did not
      take the trouble to put on dry linen. She wished the pot to be on the fire
      with the water, the white wine, the carrots and spices, before the family
      arrived. And she came and went, attending to the fire and filling the
      whole kitchen with her gay activity, like a good housewife who was glad to
      display her accomplishments, while her betrothed, who had also come
      downstairs again after changing his clothes, watched her with a kind of
      religious admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when the whole family had arrived, the folks of the brake and the
      pedestrians also, there came a rather sharp explanation. Mathieu and
      Marianne were angry, so greatly had they been alarmed by that rush through
      the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no sense in it, my girl,&rdquo; Marianne repeated. &ldquo;Did you at least
      change your linen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, why yes!&rdquo; replied Rose. &ldquo;Where are the crawfish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu meantime was lecturing Frederic. &ldquo;You might have broken your
      necks,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and, besides, it is by no means good to get soaked with
      cold water when one is hot. You ought to have stopped her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she insisted on going on, and whenever she insists on anything, you
      know, I haven&rsquo;t the strength to prevent her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Rose, in her pretty way, put an end to the reproaches. &ldquo;Come,
      that&rsquo;s enough scolding; I did wrong, no doubt. But won&rsquo;t anybody
      compliment me on my <i>court-bouillon</i>? Have you ever known crawfish to
      smell as nice as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lunch was wonderfully gay. As they were twenty, and wished to have a
      real rehearsal of the wedding feast, the table had been set in a large
      gallery adjoining the ordinary dining-room. This gallery was still bare,
      but throughout the meal they talked incessantly of how they would
      embellish it with shrubs, garlands of foliage, and clumps of flowers.
      During the dessert they even sent for a ladder with the view of indicating
      on the walls the main lines of the decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or so Rose, previously so talkative, had lapsed into silence.
      She had eaten heartily, but all the color had left her face, which had
      assumed a waxy pallor under her heavy hair, which was still damp. And when
      she wished to ascend the ladder herself to indicate how some ornament
      should be placed, her legs suddenly failed her, she staggered, and then
      fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was in consternation, but she was promptly placed in a chair,
      where for a few minutes longer she remained unconscious. Then, on coming
      to her senses, she remained for a moment silent, oppressed as by a feeling
      of pain, and apparently failing to understand what had taken place.
      Mathieu and Marianne, terribly upset, pressed her with questions, anxious
      as they were to know if she felt better. She had evidently caught cold,
      and this was the fine result of her foolish ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the girl recovered her composure, and again smiled. She then
      explained that she now felt no pain, but that it had suddenly seemed to
      her as if a heavy paving-stone were lying on her chest; then this weight
      had melted away, leaving her better able to breathe. And, indeed, she was
      soon on her feet once more, and finished giving her views respecting the
      decoration of the gallery, in such wise that the others ended by feeling
      reassured, and the afternoon passed away joyously in the making of all
      sorts of splendid plans. Little was eaten at dinner, for they had done too
      much honor to the crawfish at noon. And at nine o&rsquo;clock, as soon as
      Celeste arrived for Andree, the gathering broke up. Ambroise was returning
      to Paris that same evening. Blaise and Denis were to take the seven
      o&rsquo;clock train the following morning. And Rose, after accompanying Madame
      Desvignes and her daughters to the road, called to them through the
      darkness: &ldquo;Au revoir, come back soon.&rdquo; She was again full of gayety at the
      thought of the general rendezvous which the family had arranged for the
      approaching weddings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mathieu nor Marianne went to bed at once, however. Though they did
      not even speak of it together, they thought that Rose looked very strange,
      as if, indeed, she were intoxicated. She had again staggered on returning
      to the house, and though she only complained of some slight oppression,
      they prevailed on her to go to bed. After she had retired to her room,
      which adjoined their own, Marianne went several times to see if she were
      well wrapped up and were sleeping peacefully, while Mathieu remained
      anxiously thoughtful beside the lamp. At last the girl fell asleep, and
      the parents, leaving the door of communication open, then exchanged a few
      words in an undertone, in their desire to tranquillize each other. It
      would surely be nothing; a good night&rsquo;s rest would suffice to restore Rose
      to her wonted health. Then in their turn they went to bed, the whole farm
      lapsed into silence, surrendering itself to slumber until the first
      cockcrow. But all at once, about four o&rsquo;clock, shortly before daybreak, a
      stifled call, &ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo; awoke both Mathieu and Marianne, and they
      sprang out of bed, barefooted, shivering, and groping for the candle. Rose
      was again stifling, struggling against another attack of extreme violence.
      For the second time, however, she soon regained consciousness and appeared
      relieved, and thus the parents, great as was their distress, preferred to
      summon nobody but to wait till daylight. Their alarm was caused
      particularly by the great change they noticed in their daughter&rsquo;s
      appearance; her face was swollen and distorted, as if some evil power had
      transformed her in the night. But she fell asleep again, in a state of
      great prostration; and they no longer stirred for fear of disturbing her
      slumber. They remained there watching and waiting, listening to the
      revival of life in the farm around them as the daylight gradually
      increased. Time went by; five and then six o&rsquo;clock struck. And at about
      twenty minutes to seven Mathieu, on looking into the yard, and there
      catching sight of Denis, who was to return to Paris by the seven o&rsquo;clock
      train, hastened down to tell him to call upon Boutan and beg the doctor to
      come at once. Then, as soon as his son had started, he rejoined Marianne
      upstairs, still unwilling to call or warn anybody. But a third attack
      followed, and this time it was the thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had half risen in bed, her arms thrown out, her mouth distended as
      she gasped &ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in a sudden fit of revolt, a last flash of life, she sprang from her
      bed and stepped towards the window, whose panes were all aglow with the
      rising sun. And for a moment she leant there, her legs bare, her shoulders
      bare, and her heavy hair falling over her like a royal mantle. Never had
      she looked more beautiful, more dazzling, full of strength and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she murmured: &ldquo;Oh! how I suffer! It is all over, I am going to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father darted towards her; her mother sustained her, throwing her arms
      around her like invincible armor which would shield her from all harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, you unhappy girl! It is nothing; it is only another
      attack which will pass away. Get into bed again, for mercy&rsquo;s sake. Your
      old friend Boutan is on his way here. You will be up and well again
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I am going to die; it is all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell back in their arms; they only had time to lay her on her bed. And
      the thunderbolt fell: without a word, without a glance, in a few minutes
      she died of congestion of the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! the imbecile thunderbolt! Ah! the scythe, which with a single stroke
      blindly cuts down a whole springtide! It was all so brutally sudden, so
      utterly unexpected, that at first the stupefaction of Marianne and Mathieu
      was greater than their despair. In response to their cries the whole farm
      hastened up, the fearful news filled the place, and then all sank into the
      deep silence of death&mdash;all work, all life ceasing. And the other
      children were there, scared and overcome: little Nicolas, who did not yet
      understand things; Gregoire, the page of the previous day; Louise,
      Madeleine, and Marguerite, the three maids of honor, and their elders,
      Claire and Gervais, who felt the blow more deeply. And there were yet the
      others journeying away, Blaise, Denis, and Ambroise, travelling to Paris
      at that very moment, in ignorance of the unforeseen, frightful
      hatchet-stroke which had fallen on the family. Where would the terrible
      tidings reach them? In what cruel distress would they return! And the
      doctor who would soon arrive too! But all at once, amid the terror and
      confusion, there rang out the cries of Frederic, the poor dead girl&rsquo;s
      affianced lover. He shrieked his despair aloud, he was half mad, he wished
      to kill himself, saying that he was the murderer and that he ought to have
      prevented Rose from so rashly riding home through the storm! He had to be
      led away and watched for fear of some fresh misfortune. His sudden frenzy
      had gone to every heart; sobs burst forth and lamentations arose from the
      woful parents, from the brothers, the sisters, from the whole of stricken
      Chantebled, which death thus visited for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, God! Rose on that bed of mourning, white, cold, and dead! She, the
      fairest, the gayest, the most loved! She, before whom all the others were
      ever in admiration&mdash;she of whom they were so proud, so fond! And to
      think that this blow should fall in the midst of hope, bright hope in long
      life and sterling happiness, but ten days before her wedding, and on the
      morrow of that day of wild gayety, all jests and laughter! They could
      again see her, full of life and so adorable with her happy youthful
      fancies&mdash;that princely reception and that royal procession. It had
      seemed as if those two coming weddings, celebrated the same day, would be
      like the supreme florescence of the family&rsquo;s long happiness and
      prosperity. Doubtless they had often experienced trouble and had even wept
      at times, but they had drawn closer together and consoled one another on
      such occasions; none had ever been cut off from the good-night embraces
      which healed every sore. And now the best was gone, death had come to say
      that absolute joy existed for none, that the most valiant, the happiest;
      never reaped the fulness of their hopes. There was no life without death.
      And they paid their share of the debt of human wretchedness, paid it the
      more dearly since they had made for themselves a larger sum of life. When
      everything germinates and grows around one, when one has determined on
      unreserved fruitfulness; on continuous creation and increase, how awful is
      the recall to the ever-present dim abyss in which the world is fashioned,
      on the day when misfortune falls, digs its first pit, and carries off a
      loved one! It is like a sudden snapping, a rending of the hopes which
      seemed to be endless, and a feeling of stupefaction comes at the discovery
      that one cannot live and love forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! how terrible were the two days that followed: the farm itself
      lifeless, without sound save that of the breathing of the cattle, the
      whole family gathered together, overcome by the cruel spell of waiting,
      ever in tears while the poor corpse remained there under a harvest of
      flowers. And there was this cruel aggravation, that on the eve of the
      funeral, when the body had been laid in the coffin, it was brought down
      into that gallery where they had lunched so merrily while discussing how
      magnificently they might decorate it for the two weddings. It was there
      that the last funeral watch, the last wake, took place, and there were no
      evergreen shrubs, no garlands of foliage, merely four tapers which burnt
      there amid a wealth of white roses gathered in the morning, but already
      fading. Neither the mother nor the father was willing to go to bed that
      night. They remained, side by side, near the child whom mother-earth was
      taking back from them. They could see her quite little again, but sixteen
      months old, at the time of their first sojourn at Chantebled in the old
      tumbledown shooting-box, when she had just been weaned and they were wont
      to go and cover her up at nighttime. They saw her also, later on, in
      Paris, hastening to them in the morning, climbing up and pulling their bed
      to pieces with triumphant laughter. And they saw her yet more clearly,
      growing and becoming more beautiful even as Chantebled did, as if, indeed,
      she herself bloomed with all the health and beauty of that now fruitful
      land. Yet she was no more, and whenever the thought returned to them that
      they would never see her again, their hands sought one another, met in a
      woful clasp, while from their crushed and mingling hearts it seemed as if
      all life, all future, were flowing away to nihility. Now that a breach had
      been made, would not every other happiness be carried off in turn? And
      though the ten other children were there, from the little one five years
      old to the twins who were four-and-twenty, all clad in black, all gathered
      in tears around their sleeping sister, like a sorrow-stricken battalion
      rendering funeral honors, neither the father nor the mother saw or counted
      them: their hearts were rent by the loss of the daughter who had departed,
      carrying away with her some of their own flesh. And in that long bare
      gallery which the four candles scarcely lighted, the dawn at last arose
      upon that death watch, that last leave-taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then grief again came with the funeral procession, which spread out along
      the white road between the lofty poplars and the green corn, that road
      over which Rose had galloped so madly through the storm. All the relations
      of the Froments, all their friends, all the district, had come to pay a
      tribute of emotion at so sudden and swift a death. Thus, this time, the
      cortege did stretch far away behind the hearse, draped with white and
      blooming with white roses in the bright sunshine. The whole family was
      present; the mother and the sisters had declared that they would only quit
      their loved one when she had been lowered into her last resting-place. And
      after the family came the friends, the Beauchenes, the Seguins, and
      others. But Mathieu and Marianne, worn out, overcome by suffering, no
      longer recognized people amid their tears. They only remembered on the
      morrow that they must have seen Morange, if indeed it were really Morange&mdash;that
      silent, unobtrusive, almost shadowy gentleman, who had wept while pressing
      their hands. And in like fashion Mathieu fancied that, in some horrible
      dream, he had seen Constance&rsquo;s spare figure and bony profile drawing near
      to him in the cemetery after the coffin had been lowered into the grave,
      and addressing vague words of consolation to him, though he fancied that
      her eyes flashed the while as if with abominable exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it that she had said? He no longer knew. Of course her words must
      have been appropriate, even as her demeanor was that of a mourning
      relative. But a memory returned to him, that of other words which she had
      spoken when promising to attend the two weddings. She had then in bitter
      fashion expressed a wish that the good fortune of Chantebled might
      continue. But they, the Froments, so fruitful and so prosperous, were now
      stricken in their turn, and their good fortune had perhaps departed
      forever! Mathieu shuddered; his faith in the future was shaken; he was
      haunted by a fear of seeing prosperity and fruitfulness vanish, now that
      there was that open breach.

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A YEAR later the first child born to Ambroise and Andree, a boy, little
      Leonce, was christened. The young people had been married very quietly six
      weeks after the death of Rose. And that christening was to be the first
      outing for Mathieu and Marianne, who had not yet fully recovered from the
      terrible shock of their eldest daughter&rsquo;s death. Moreover, it was arranged
      that after the ceremony there should simply be a lunch at the parents&rsquo; 
      home, and that one and all should afterwards be free to return to his or
      her avocations. It was impossible for the whole family to come, and,
      indeed, apart from the grandfather and grandmother, only the twins, Denis
      and Blaise, and the latter&rsquo;s wife Charlotte, were expected, together with
      the godparents. Beauchene, the godfather, had selected Madame Seguin as
      his <i>commere</i>, for, since the death of Maurice, Constance shuddered
      at the bare thought of touching a child. At the same time she had promised
      to be present at the lunch, and thus there would be ten of them,
      sufficient to fill the little dining-room of the modest flat in the Rue de
      La Boetie, where the young couple resided pending fortune&rsquo;s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very pleasant morning. Although Mathieu and Marianne had been
      unwilling to set aside their black garments even for this rejoicing, they
      ended by evincing some gentle gayety before the cradle of that little
      grandson, whose advent brought them a renewal of hope. Early in the winter
      a fresh bereavement had fallen on the family; Blaise had lost his little
      Christophe, then two and a half years old, through an attack of croup.
      Charlotte, however, was already at that time again <i>enceinte</i>, and
      thus the grief of the first days had turned to expectancy fraught with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little flat in the Rue de La Boetie seemed very bright and fragrant;
      it was perfumed by the fair grace of Andree and illumined by the
      victorious charm of Ambroise, that handsome loving couple who, arm in arm,
      had set out so bravely to conquer the world. During the lunch, too, there
      was the formidable appetite and jovial laughter of Beauchene, who gave the
      greatest attention to his <i>commere</i> Valentine, jesting and paying her
      the most extravagant court, which afforded her much amusement, prone as
      she still was to play a girlish part, though she was already forty-five
      and a grandmother like Marianne. Constance alone remained grave, scarce
      condescending to bend her thin lips into a faint smile, while a shadow of
      deep pain passed over her withered face every time that she glanced round
      that gay table, whence new strength, based on the invincible future, arose
      in spite of all the recent mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about three o&rsquo;clock Blaise rose from the table, refusing to allow
      Beauchene to take any more Chartreuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, he is right, my children,&rdquo; Beauchene ended by exclaiming in a
      docile way. &ldquo;We are very comfortable here, but it is absolutely necessary
      that we should return to the works. And we must deprive you of Denis, for
      we need his help over a big building affair. That&rsquo;s how we are, we others,
      we don&rsquo;t shirk duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance had also risen. &ldquo;The carriage must be waiting,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;will
      you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, we will go on foot. A walk will clear our heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sky was overcast, and as it grew darker and darker Ambroise, going to
      the window, exclaimed: &ldquo;You will get wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the rain has been threatening ever since this morning, but we shall
      have time to get to the works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then understood that Constance should take Charlotte with her in
      the brougham and set her down at the door of the little pavilion adjoining
      the factory. As for Valentine, she was in no hurry and could quietly
      return to the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin, which was close by, as soon as the sky might
      clear. And with regard to Marianne and Mathieu, they had just yielded to
      Andree&rsquo;s affectionate entreaties, and had arranged to spend the whole day
      and dine there, returning to Chantebled by the last train. Thus the fete
      would be complete, and the young couple were enraptured at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departure of the others was enlivened by a curious incident, a mistake
      which Constance made, and which seemed very comical amid all the mirth
      promoted by the copious lunch. She had turned towards Denis, and, looking
      at him with her pale eyes, she quietly asked him &ldquo;Blaise, my friend, will
      you give me my boa? I must have left it in the ante-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody began to laugh, but she failed to understand the reason. And it
      was in the same tranquil way as before that she thanked Denis when he
      brought her the boa: &ldquo;I am obliged to you, Blaise; you are very amiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon came an explosion; the others almost choked with laughter, so
      droll did her quiet assurance seem to them. What was the matter, then? Why
      did they all laugh at her in that fashion? She ended by suspecting that
      she had made a mistake, and looked more attentively at the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, it isn&rsquo;t Blaise, but Denis! But it can&rsquo;t be helped. I am always
      mistaking them since they have worn their beards trimmed in the same
      fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Marianne, in her obliging way, in order to take any sting away
      from the laughter, repeated the well-known family story of how she
      herself, when the twins were children and slept together, had been wont to
      awake them in order to identify them by the different color of their eyes.
      The others, Beauchene and Valentine, then intervened and recalled
      circumstances under which they also had mistaken the twins one for the
      other, so perfect was their resemblance on certain occasions, in certain
      lights. And it was amid all this gay animation that the company separated
      after exchanging all sorts of embraces and handshakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the brougham, Constance spoke but seldom to Charlotte, taking as a
      pretext a violent headache which the prolonged lunch had increased. With a
      weary air and her eyes half closed she began to reflect. After Rose&rsquo;s
      death, and when little Christophe likewise had been carried off, a revival
      of hope had come to her, for all at once she had felt quite young again.
      But when she consulted Boutan on the matter he dealt her a final blow by
      informing her that her hopes were quite illusive. Thus, for two months
      now, her rage and despair had been increasing. That very morning at that
      christening, and now in that carriage beside that young woman who was
      again expecting to become a mother, it was this which poisoned her mind,
      filled her with jealousy and spite, and rendered her capable of any evil
      deed. The loss of her son, the childlessness to which she was condemned,
      all threw her into a state of morbid perversity, fraught with dreams of
      some monstrous vengeance which she dared not even confess to herself. She
      accused the whole world of being in league to crush her. Her husband was
      the most cowardly and idiotic of traitors, for he betrayed her by letting
      some fresh part of the works pass day by day into the hands of that fellow
      Blaise, whose wife no sooner lost a child than she had another. She,
      Constance, was enraged also at seeing her husband so gay and happy, since
      she had left him to his own base courses. He still retained his air of
      victorious superiority, declaring that he had remained unchanged, and
      there was truth in this; for though, instead of being an active master as
      formerly, he now too often showed himself a senile prowler, on the high
      road to paralysis, he yet continued to be a practical egotist, one who
      drew from life the greatest sum of enjoyment possible. He was following
      his destined road, and if he took to Blaise it was simply because he was
      delighted to have found an intelligent, hard-working young man who spared
      him all the cares and worries that were too heavy for his weary shoulders,
      while still earning for him the money which he needed for his pleasures.
      Constance knew that something in the way of a partnership arrangement was
      about to be concluded. Indeed, her husband must have already received a
      large sum to enable him to make good certain losses and expenses which he
      had hidden from her. And closing her eyes as the brougham rolled along,
      she poisoned her mind by ruminating all these things, scarce able to
      refrain from venting her fury by throwing herself upon that young woman
      Charlotte, well-loved and fruitful spouse, who sat beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thought of Denis occurred to her. Why was he being taken to the
      works? Did he also mean to rob her? Yet she knew that he had refused to
      join his brother, as in his opinion there was not room for two at the
      establishment of the Boulevard de Grenelle. Indeed, Denis&rsquo;s ambition was
      to direct some huge works by himself; he possessed an extensive knowledge
      of mechanics, and this it was that rendered him a valuable adviser
      whenever a new model of some important agricultural machine had to be
      prepared at the Beauchene factory. Constance promptly dismissed him from
      her thoughts; in her estimation there was no reason to fear him; he was a
      mere passer-by, who on the morrow, perhaps, would establish himself at the
      other end of France. Then once more the thought of Blaise came back to
      her, imperative, all-absorbing; and it suddenly occurred to her that if
      she made haste home she would be able to see Morange alone in his office
      and ascertain many things from him before the others arrived. It was
      evident that the accountant must know something of the partnership scheme,
      even if it were as yet only in a preliminary stage. Thereupon she became
      impassioned, eager to arrive, certain as she felt of obtaining
      confidential information from Morange, whom she deemed to be devoted to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage rolled over the Jena bridge she opened her eyes and looked
      out. &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what a time this brougham takes! If the
      rain would only fall it would, perhaps, relieve my head a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking, however, that a sharp shower would give her more time,
      as it would compel the three men, Beauchene, Denis, and Blaise, to seek
      shelter in some doorway. And when the carriage reached the works she
      hastily stopped the coachman, without even conducting her companion to the
      little pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, won&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you only have to turn
      the street corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had both alighted, Charlotte, smiling and affectionate, took
      hold of Constance&rsquo;s hand and retained it for a few moments in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and many thanks. You are too kind. When you see
      my husband, pray tell him that you left me safe, for he grows anxious at
      the slightest thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Constance in her turn had to smile and promise with many
      professions of friendship that she would duly execute the commission. Then
      they parted. &ldquo;Au revoir, till to-morrow &ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, yes, till to-morrow,
      au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen years had now already elapsed since Morange had lost his wife
      Valerie; and nine had gone by since the death of his daughter Reine. Yet
      it always seemed as if he were on the morrow of those disasters, for he
      had retained his black garb, and still led a cloister-like, retired life,
      giving utterance only to such words as were indispensable. On the other
      hand, he had again become a good model clerk, a correct painstaking
      accountant, very punctual in his habits, and rooted as it were to the
      office chair in which he had taken his seat every morning for thirty years
      past. The truth was that his wife and his daughter had carried off with
      them all his will-power, all his ambitious thoughts, all that he had
      momentarily dreamt of winning for their sakes&mdash;a large fortune and a
      luxurious triumphant life. He, who was now so much alone, who had relapsed
      into childish timidity and weakness, sought nothing beyond his humble
      daily task, and was content to die in the shady corner to which he was
      accustomed. It was suspected, however, that he led a mysterious maniacal
      life, tinged with anxious jealousy, at home, in that flat of the Boulevard
      de Grenelle which he had so obstinately refused to quit. His servant had
      orders to admit nobody, and she herself knew nothing. If he gave her free
      admittance to the dining- and drawing-rooms, he did not allow her to set
      foot in his own bedroom, formerly shared by Valerie, nor in that which
      Reine had occupied. He himself alone entered these chambers, which he
      regarded as sanctuaries, of which he was the sole priest. Under pretence
      of sweeping or dusting, he would shut himself up in one or the other of
      them for hours at a time. It was in vain that the servant tried to glance
      inside, in vain that she listened at the doors when he spent his holidays
      at home; she saw nothing and heard nothing. Nobody could have told what
      relics those chapels contained, nor with what religious cult he honored
      them. Another cause of surprise was his niggardly, avaricious life, which,
      as time went on, had become more and more pronounced, in such wise that
      his only expenses were his rental of sixteen hundred francs, the wages he
      paid to his servant, and the few pence per day which she with difficulty
      extracted from him to defray the cost of food and housekeeping. His salary
      had now risen to eight thousand francs a year, and he certainly did not
      spend half of it. What became, then, of his big savings, the money which
      he refused to devote to enjoyment? In what secret hole, and for what
      purpose, what secret passion, did he conceal it? Nobody could tell. But
      amid it all he remained very gentle, and, unlike most misers, continued
      very cleanly in his habits, keeping his beard, which was now white as
      snow, very carefully tended. And he came to his office every morning with
      a little smile on his face, in such wise that nothing in this man of
      regular methodical life revealed the collapse within him, all the ashes
      and smoldering fire which disaster had left in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees a link of some intimacy had been formed between Constance and
      Morange. When, after his daughter&rsquo;s death, she had seen him return to the
      works quite a wreck, she had been stirred by deep pity, with which some
      covert personal anxiety confusedly mingled. Maurice was destined to live
      five years longer, but she was already haunted by apprehensions, and could
      never meet Morange without experiencing a chilling shudder, for he, as she
      repeated to herself, had lost his only child. &ldquo;Ah, God! so such a
      catastrophe was possible.&rdquo; Then, on being stricken herself, on
      experiencing the horrible distress, on smarting from the sudden, gaping,
      incurable wound of her bereavement, she had drawn nearer to that brother
      in misfortune, treating him with a kindness which she showed to none
      other. At times she would invite him to spend an evening with her, and the
      pair of them would chat together, or more often remain silent, face to
      face, sharing each other&rsquo;s woe. Later on she had profited by this intimacy
      to obtain information from Morange respecting affairs at the factory, of
      which her husband avoided speaking. It was more particularly since she had
      suspected the latter of bad management, blunders and debts, that she
      endeavored to turn the accountant into a confidant, even a spy, who might
      aid her to secure as much control of the business as possible. And this
      was why she was so anxious to return to the factory that day, and profit
      by the opportunity to see Morange privately, persuaded as she was that she
      would induce him to speak out in the absence of his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely tarried to take off her gloves and her bonnet. She found the
      accountant in his little office, seated in his wonted place, and leaning
      over the everlasting ledger which was open before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is the christening finished?&rdquo; he exclaimed in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith she explained her presence in such a way as to enable her to
      speak of what she had at heart. &ldquo;Why, yes. That is to say, I came away
      because I had such a dreadful headache. The others have remained yonder.
      And as we are alone here together it occurred to me that it might do me
      good to have a chat with you. You know how highly I esteem you. Ah! I am
      not happy, not happy at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sunk upon a chair overcome by the tears which she had been
      restraining so long in the presence of the happiness of others. Quite
      upset at seeing her in this condition, having little strength himself,
      Morange wished to summon her maid. He almost feared that she might have a
      fainting fit. But she prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only you left me, my friend,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Everybody else forsakes
      me, everybody is against me. I can feel it; I am being ruined; folks are
      bent on annihilating me, as if I had not already lost everything when I
      lost my child. And since you alone remain to me, you who know my torments,
      you who have no daughter left you, pray for heaven&rsquo;s sake help me and tell
      me the truth! In that wise I shall at least be able to defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing her speak of his daughter Morange also had begun to weep. And
      now, therefore, she might question him, it was certain that he would
      answer and tell her everything, overpowered as he was by the common grief
      which she had evoked. Thus he informed her that an agreement was indeed on
      the point of being signed by Blaise and Beauchene, only it was not
      precisely a deed of partnership. Beauchene having drawn large sums from
      the strong-box of the establishment for expenses which he could not
      confess&mdash;a horrible story of blackmailing, so it was rumored&mdash;had
      been obliged to make a confidant of Blaise, the trusty and active
      lieutenant who managed the establishment. And he had even asked him to
      find somebody willing to lend him some money. Thereupon the young man had
      offered it himself; but doubtless it was his father, Mathieu Froment, who
      advanced the cash, well pleased to invest it in the works in his son&rsquo;s
      name. And now, with the view of putting everything in order, it had been
      resolved that the property should be divided into six parts, and that one
      of these parts or shares should be attributed to Blaise as reimbursement
      for the loan. Thus the young fellow would possess an interest of one sixth
      in the establishment, unless indeed Beauchene should buy him out again
      within a stipulated period. The danger was that, instead of freeing
      himself in this fashion, Beauchene might yield to the temptation of
      selling the other parts one by one, now that he was gliding down a path of
      folly and extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance listened to Morange, quivering and quite pale. &ldquo;Is this signed?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. But the papers are ready and will be signed shortly.
      Moreover, it is a reasonable and necessary solution of the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently of another opinion. A feeling of revolt possessed her,
      and she strove to think of some decisive means of preventing the ruin and
      shame which in her opinion threatened her. &ldquo;My God, what am I to do? How
      can I act?&rdquo; she gasped; and then, in her rage at finding no device, at
      being powerless, this cry escaped her: &ldquo;Ah! that scoundrel Blaise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Worthy Morange was quite moved by it. Still he had not fully understood.
      And so, in his quiet way, he endeavored to calm Constance, explaining that
      Blaise had a very good heart, and that in the circumstances in question he
      had behaved in the best way possible, doing all that he could to stifle
      scandal, and even displaying great disinterestedness. And as Constance had
      risen, satisfied with knowing the truth, and anxious that the three men
      might not find her there on their arrival, the accountant likewise quitted
      his chair, and accompanied her along the gallery which she had to follow
      in order to return to her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honor, madame,&rdquo; said Morange, &ldquo;that the young man
      has made no base calculations in the matter. All the papers pass through
      my hands, and nobody could know more than I know myself. Besides, if I had
      entertained the slightest doubt of any machination, I should have
      endeavored to requite your kindness by warning you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She no longer listened to him, however; in fact, she was anxious to get
      rid of him, for all at once the long-threatening rain had begun to fall
      violently, lashing the glass roof. So dark a mass of clouds had overspread
      the sky that it was almost night in the gallery, though four o&rsquo;clock had
      scarcely struck. And it occurred to Constance that in presence of such a
      deluge the three men would certainly take a cab. So she hastened her
      steps, still followed, however, by the accountant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when it was a question of drawing up the
      agreement&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he suddenly paused, gave vent to a hoarse exclamation, and stopped
      her, pulling her back as if in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great cavity before them. Here, at the end of the gallery,
      before reaching the corridor which communicated with the private house,
      there was a steam lift of great power, which was principally used for
      lowering heavy articles to the packing room. It only worked as a rule on
      certain days; on all others the huge trap remained closed. When the
      appliance was working a watchman was always stationed there to superintend
      the operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! take care!&rdquo; Morange repeated, shuddering with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trap was open, and the huge cavity gaped before them; there was no
      barrier, nothing to warn them and prevent them from making a fearful
      plunge. The rain still pelted on the glass roof, and the darkness had
      become so complete in the gallery that they had walked on without seeing
      anything before them. Another step would have hurled them to destruction.
      It was little short of miraculous that the accountant should have become
      anxious in presence of the increasing gloom in that corner, where he had
      divined rather than perceived the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, however, still failing to understand her companion, sought to
      free herself from his wild grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he bent forward and compelled her also to stoop over the cavity. It
      descended through three floors to the very lowest basement, like a well of
      darkness. A damp odor arose: one could scarce distinguish the vague
      outlines of thick ironwork; alone, right at the bottom, burnt a lantern, a
      distant speck of light, as if the better to indicate the depth and horror
      of the gulf. Morange and Constance drew back again blanching.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Morange burst into a temper. &ldquo;It is idiotic!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t they obey the regulations! As a rule there is a man here, a man
      expressly told off for this duty, who ought not to stir from his post so
      long as the trap has not come up again. Where is he? What on earth can the
      rascal be up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accountant again approached the hole, and shouted down it in a fury:
      &ldquo;Bonnard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply came: the pit remained bottomless, black and void.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bonnard! Bonnard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still nothing was heard, not a sound; the damp breath of the darkness
      alone ascended as from the deep silence of the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Morange resorted to action. &ldquo;I must go down; I must find
      Bonnard. Can you picture us falling through that hole to the very bottom?
      No, no, this cannot be allowed. Either he must close this trap or return
      to his post. What can he be doing? Where can he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange had already betaken himself to a little winding staircase, by
      which one reached every floor beside the lift, when in a voice which
      gradually grew more indistinct, he again called: &ldquo;I beg you, madame, pray
      wait for me; remain there to warn anybody who might pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance was alone. The dull rattle of the rain on the glass above her
      continued, but a little livid light was appearing as a gust of wind
      carried off the clouds. And in that pale light Blaise suddenly appeared at
      the end of the gallery. He had just returned to the factory with Denis and
      Beauchene, and had left his companions together for a moment, in order to
      go to the workshops to procure some information they required.
      Preoccupied, absorbed once more in his work, he came along with an easy
      step, his head somewhat bent. And when Constance saw him thus appear, all
      that she felt in her heart was the smart of rancor, a renewal of her anger
      at what she had learnt of that agreement which was to be signed on the
      morrow and which would despoil her. That enemy who was in her home and
      worked against her, a revolt of her whole being urged her to exterminate
      him, and thrust him out like some usurper, all craft and falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew nearer. She was in the dense shadow near the wall, so that he
      could not see her. But on her side, as he softly approached steeped in a
      grayish light, she could see him with singular distinctness. Never before
      had she so plainly divined the power of his lofty brow, the intelligence
      of his eyes, the firm will of his mouth. And all at once she was struck
      with fulgural certainty; he was coming towards the cavity without seeing
      it and he would assuredly plunge into the depths unless she should stop
      him as he passed. But a little while before, she, like himself, had come
      from yonder, and would have fallen unless a friendly hand had restrained
      her; and the frightful shudder of that moment yet palpitated in her veins;
      she could still and ever see the damp black pit with the little lantern
      far below. The whole horror of it flashed before her eyes&mdash;the ground
      failing one, the sudden drop with a great shriek, and the smash a moment
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise drew yet nearer. But certainly such a thing was impossible; she
      would prevent it, since a little motion of her hand would suffice. Would
      she not always have time to stretch out her arms when he was there before
      her? And yet from the recesses of her being a very clear and frigid voice
      seemed to ascend, articulating brief words which rang in her ears as if
      repeated by a trumpet blast. If he should die it would be all over, the
      factory would never belong to him. She who had bitterly lamented that she
      could devise no obstacle had merely to let this helpful chance take its
      own course. And this, indeed, was what the voice said, what it repeated
      with keen insistence, never adding another syllable. After that there
      would be nothing. After that there would merely remain the shattered
      remnants of a suppressed man, and a pit of darkness splashed with blood,
      in which she discerned, foresaw nothing more. What would happen on the
      morrow? She did not wish to know; indeed there would be no morrow. It was
      solely the brutal immediate fact which the imperious voice demanded. He
      dead, it would be all over, he would never possess the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew nearer still. And within her now there raged a frightful battle.
      How long did it last&mdash;days? years? Doubtless but a few seconds. She
      was still resolved that she would stop him as he passed, certain as she
      felt that she would conquer her horrible thoughts when the moment came for
      the decisive gesture. And yet those thoughts invaded her, became
      materialized within her, like some physical craving, thirst or hunger. She
      hungered for that finish, hungered to the point of suffering, seized by
      one of those sudden desperate longings which beget crime; such as when a
      passer-by is despoiled and throttled at the corner of a street. It seemed
      to her that if she could not satisfy her craving she herself must lose her
      life. A consuming passion, a mad desire for that man&rsquo;s annihilation filled
      her as she saw him approach. She could now see him still more plainly and
      the sight of him exasperated her. His forehead, his eyes, his lips
      tortured her like some hateful spectacle. Another step, yet one more, then
      another, and he would be before her. Yes, yet another step, and she was
      already stretching out her hand in readiness to stop him as soon as he
      should brush past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came along. What was it that happened? O God! When he was there, so
      absorbed in his thoughts that he brushed against her without feeling her,
      she turned to stone. Her hand became icy cold, she could not lift it, it
      hung too heavily from her arm. And amid her scorching fever a great cold
      shudder came upon her, immobilizing and stupefying her, while she was
      deafened by the clamorous voice rising from the depths of her being. All
      demur was swept away; the craving for that death remained intense,
      invincible, beneath the imperious stubborn call of the inner voice which
      robbed her of the power of will and action. He would be dead and he would
      never possess the works. And therefore, standing stiff and breathless
      against the wall, she did not stop him. She could hear his light
      breathing, she could discern his profile, then the nape of his neck. He
      had passed. Another step, another step! And yet if she had raised a call
      she might still have changed the course of destiny even at that last
      moment. She fancied that she had some such intention, but she was
      clenching her teeth tightly enough to break them. And he, Blaise, took yet
      a further step, still advancing quietly and confidently over that friendly
      ground, without even a glance before him, absorbed as he was in thoughts
      of his work. And the ground failed him, and there was a loud, terrible
      cry, a sudden gust following the fall, and a dull crash down below in the
      depths of the black darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance did not stir. For a moment she remained as if petrified, still
      listening, still waiting. But only deep silence arose from the abyss. She
      could merely hear the rain pelting on the glass roof with renewed rage.
      And thereupon she fled, turned into the passage, re-entered her
      drawing-room. There she collected and questioned herself. Had she desired
      that abominable thing? No, her will had had nought to do with it. Most
      certainly it had been paralyzed, prevented from acting. If it had been
      possible for the thing to occur, it had occurred quite apart from her, for
      assuredly she had been absent. Absent, that word reassured her. Yes,
      indeed, that was the case, she had been absent. All her past life spread
      out behind her, faultless, pure of any evil action. Never had she sinned,
      never until that day had any consciousness of guilt weighed upon her
      conscience. An honest and virtuous woman, she had remained upright amidst
      all the excesses of her husband. An impassioned mother, she had been
      ascending her calvary ever since her son&rsquo;s death. And this recollection of
      Maurice alone drew her for a moment from her callousness, choked her with
      a rising sob, as if in that direction lay her madness, the vainly sought
      explanation of the crime. Vertigo again fell upon her, the thought of her
      dead son and of the other being master in his place, all her perverted
      passion for that only son of hers, the despoiled prince, all her poisoned,
      fermenting rage which had unhinged and maddened her, even to the point of
      murder. Had that monstrous vegetation growing within her reached her brain
      then? A rush of blood suffices at times to bedim a conscience. But she
      obstinately clung to the view that she had been absent; she forced back
      her tears and remained frigid. No remorse came to her. It was done, and
      &lsquo;twas good that it should be done. It was necessary. She had not pushed
      him, he himself had fallen. Had she not been there he would have fallen
      just the same. And so since she had not been there, since both her brain
      and her heart had been absent, it did not concern her. And ever and ever
      resounded the words which absolved her and chanted her victory; he was
      dead, and would never possess the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erect in the middle of the drawing-room, Constance listened, straining her
      ears. Why was it that she heard nothing? How long they were in going down
      to pick him up! Anxiously waiting for the tumult which she expected, the
      clamor of horror which would assuredly rise from the works, the heavy
      footsteps, the loud calls, she held her breath, quivering at the
      slightest, faintest sound. Several minutes still elapsed, and the cosey
      quietude of her drawing-room pleased her. That room was like an asylum of
      bourgeois rectitude, luxurious dignity, in which she felt protected,
      saved. Some little objects on which her eyes lighted, a pocket
      scent-bottle ornamented with an opal, a paper-knife of burnished silver
      left inside a book, fully reassured her. She was moved, almost surprised
      at the sight of them, as if they had acquired some new and particular
      meaning. Then she shivered slightly and perceived that her hands were icy
      cold. She rubbed them together gently, wishing to warm them a little. Why
      was it, too, that she now felt so tired? It seemed to her as if she had
      just returned from some long walk, from some accident, from some affray in
      which she had been bruised. She felt within her also a tendency to
      somnolence, the somnolence of satiety, as if she had feasted too copiously
      off some spicy dish, after too great a hunger. Amid the fatigue which
      benumbed her limbs she desired nothing more; apart from her sleepiness all
      that she felt was a kind of astonishment that things should be as they
      were. However, she had again begun to listen, repeating that if that
      frightful silence continued, she would certainly sink upon a chair, close
      her eyes, and sleep. And at last it seemed to her that she detected a
      faint sound, scarcely a breath, far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it? No, there was nothing yet. Perhaps she had dreamt that
      horrible scene, perhaps it had all been a nightmare; that man marching on,
      that black pit, that loud cry of terror! Since she heard nothing, perhaps
      nothing had really happened. Were it true a clamor would have ascended
      from below in a growing wave of sound, and a distracted rush up the
      staircase and along the passages would have brought her the news. Then
      again she detected the faint distant sound, which seemed to draw a little
      nearer. It was not the tramping of a crowd; it seemed to be a mere
      footfall, perhaps that of some pedestrian on the quay. Yet no; it came
      from the works, and now it was quite distinct; it ascended steps and then
      sped along a passage. And the steps became quicker, and a panting could be
      heard, so tragical that she at last divined that the horror was at hand.
      All at once the door was violently flung open. Morange entered. He was
      alone, beside himself, with livid face and scarce able to stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He still breathes, but his head is smashed; it is all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, agape. He had hastened upstairs at a run to ask her for
      an explanation, for he had quite lost his poor head over that
      unaccountable catastrophe. And the apparent ignorance and tranquillity in
      which he found Constance completed his dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I left you near the trap,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the trap, yes. You went down, and I immediately came up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before I went down,&rdquo; he resumed with despairing violence, &ldquo;I begged
      you to wait for me and keep a watch on the hole, so that nobody might fall
      through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear no. You said nothing to me, or, at all events, I heard nothing,
      understood nothing of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his terror he peered into her eyes. Assuredly she was lying. Calm as
      she might appear, he could detect her voice trembling. Besides, it was
      evident she must still have been there, since he had not even had time to
      get below before it happened. And all at once he recalled their
      conversation, the questions she had asked him and her cry of hatred
      against the unfortunate young fellow who had now been picked up, covered
      with blood, in the depths of that abyss. Beneath the gust of horror which
      chilled him, Morange could only find these words: &ldquo;Well, madame, poor
      Blaise came just behind you and broke his skull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her demeanor was perfect; her hands quivered as she raised them, and it
      was in a halting voice that she exclaimed: &ldquo;Good Lord! good Lord, what a
      frightful misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment an uproar arose through the house. The drawing-room
      door had remained open, and the voices and footsteps of a number of people
      drew nearer, became each moment more distinct. Orders were being given on
      the stairs, men were straining and drawing breath, there were all the
      signs of the approach of some cumbrous burden, carried as gently as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is he being brought up here to me?&rdquo; exclaimed Constance turning
      pale, and her involuntary cry would have sufficed to enlighten the
      accountant had he needed it. &ldquo;He is being brought to me here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not Morange who answered; he was stupefied by the blow. But
      Beauchene abruptly appeared preceding the body, and he likewise was livid
      and beside himself, to such a degree did this sudden visit of death thrill
      him with fear, in his need of happy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morange will have told you of the frightful catastrophe, my dear,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Fortunately Denis was there, for the question of responsibility
      towards his family. And it was Denis, too, who, just as we were about to
      carry the poor fellow home to the pavilion, opposed it, saying that, given
      his wife&rsquo;s condition, we should kill her if we carried him to her in this
      dying state. And so the only course was to bring him here, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he quitted his wife with a gesture of bewilderment, and returned to
      the landing, where one could hear him repeating in a quivering voice:
      &ldquo;Gently, gently, take care of the balusters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lugubrious train entered the drawing-room. Blaise had been laid on a
      stretcher provided with a mattress. Denis, as pale as linen, followed,
      supporting the pillow on which rested his brother&rsquo;s head. A little
      streamlet of blood coursed over the dying man&rsquo;s brow, his eyes were
      closed. And four factory hands held the shafts of the stretcher. Their
      heavy shoes crushed down the carpet, and fragile articles of furniture
      were thrust aside anyhow to open a passage for this invasion of horror and
      of fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid his bewilderment, an idea occurred to Beauchene, who continued to
      direct the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t leave him there. There is a bed in the next room. We will
      take him up very gently with the mattress, and lay him with it on the
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Maurice&rsquo;s room; it was the bed in which Maurice had died, and which
      Constance with maternal piety had kept unchanged, consecrating the room to
      her son&rsquo;s memory. But what could she say? How could she prevent Blaise
      from dying there in his turn, killed by her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The abomination of it all, the vengeance of destiny which exacted this
      sacrilege, filled her with such a feeling of revolt that at the moment
      when vertigo was about to seize her and the flooring began to flee from
      beneath her feet, she was lashed by it and kept erect. And then she
      displayed extraordinary strength, will, and insolent courage. When the
      stricken man passed before her, her puny little frame stiffened and grew.
      She looked at him, and her yellow face remained motionless, save for a
      flutter of her eyelids and an involuntary nervous twinge on the left side
      of her mouth, which forced a slight grimace. But that was all, and again
      she became perfect both in words and gesture, doing and saying what was
      necessary without lavishness, but like one simply thunderstruck by the
      suddenness of the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the orders had been carried out in the bedroom, and the bearers
      withdrew greatly upset. Down below, directly the accident had been
      discovered, old Moineaud had been told to take a cab and hasten to Dr.
      Boutan&rsquo;s to bring him back with a surgeon, if one could be found on the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, I prefer to have him here rather than in the basement,&rdquo;
       Beauchene repeated mechanically as he stood before the bed. &ldquo;He still
      breathes. There! see, it is quite apparent. Who knows? Perhaps Boutan may
      be able to pull him through, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis, however, entertained no illusions. He had taken one of his
      brother&rsquo;s cold yielding hands in his own and he could feel that it was
      again becoming a mere thing, as if broken, wrenched away from life in that
      great fall. For a moment he remained motionless beside the death-bed, with
      the mad hope they he might, perhaps, by his clasp infuse a little of the
      blood in his own heart into the veins of the dying man. Was not that blood
      common to them both? Had not their twin brotherhood drunk life from the
      same source? It was the other half of himself that was about to die. Down
      below, after raising a loud cry of heartrending distress, he had said
      nothing. Now all at once he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must go to Ambroise&rsquo;s to warn my mother and father. Since he still
      breathes, perhaps they will arrive soon enough to embrace him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go to fetch them?&rdquo; Beauchene good-naturedly inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! thanks. I did at first think of asking that service of you, but I
      have reflected. Nobody but myself can break this horrible news to mamma.
      And nothing must be done as yet with regard to Charlotte. We will see
      about that by and by, when I come back. I only hope that death will have a
      little patience, so that I may find my poor brother still alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant forward and kissed Blaise, who with his eyes closed remained
      motionless, still breathing faintly. Then distractedly Denis printed
      another kiss upon his hand and hurried off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance meantime was busying herself, calling the maid, and requesting
      her to bring some warm water in order that they might wash the sufferer&rsquo;s
      blood-stained brow. It was impossible to think of taking off his jacket;
      they had to content themselves with doing the little they could to improve
      his appearance pending the arrival of the doctor. And during these
      preparations, Beauchene, haunted, worried by the accident, again began to
      speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is incomprehensible. One can hardly believe such a stupid mischance to
      be possible. Down below the transmission gearing gets out of order, and
      this prevents the mechanician from sending the trap up again. Then, up
      above, Bonnard gets angry, calls, and at last decides to go down in a fury
      when he finds that nobody answers him. Then Morange arrives, flies into a
      temper, and goes down in his turn, exasperated at receiving no answer to
      his calls for Bonnard. Poor Bonnard! he&rsquo;s sobbing; he wanted to kill
      himself when he saw the fine result of his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Beauchene abruptly broke off and turned to Constance. &ldquo;But
      what about you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Morange told me that he had left you up above
      near the trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in front of her husband, in the full light which came
      through the window. And again did her eyelids beat while a little nervous
      twinge slightly twisted her mouth on the left side. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why I had gone down the passage. I came back here at once, as Morange
      knows very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment previously, Morange, annihilated, his legs failing him, had sunk
      upon a chair. Incapable of rendering any help, he sat there silent,
      awaiting the end. When he heard Constance lie in that quiet fashion, he
      looked at her. The assassin was herself, he no longer doubted it. And at
      that moment he felt a craving to proclaim it, to cry it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he thought that he had begged you to remain there on the watch,&rdquo;
       Beauchene resumed, addressing his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events his words never reached me,&rdquo; Constance duly answered.
      &ldquo;Should I have moved if he had asked me to do that?&rdquo; And turning towards
      the accountant she, in her turn, had the courage to fix her pale eyes upon
      him. &ldquo;Just remember, Morange, you rushed down like a madman, you said
      nothing to me, and I went on my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beneath those pale eyes, keen as steel, which dived into his own, Morange
      was seized with abject fear. All his weakness, his cowardice of heart
      returned. Could he accuse her of such an atrocious crime? He pictured the
      consequences. And then, too, he no longer knew if he were right or not;
      his poor maniacal mind was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I may simply have thought I spoke. And it
      must be so since it can&rsquo;t be otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he relapsed into silence with a gesture of utter lassitude. The
      complicity demanded was accepted. For a moment he thought of rising to see
      if Blaise still breathed; but he did not dare. Deep peacefulness fell upon
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! how great was the anguish, the torture in the cab, when Blaise brought
      Mathieu and Marianne back with him. He had at first spoken to them simply
      of an accident, a rather serious fall. But as the vehicle rolled along he
      had lost his self-possession, weeping and confessing the truth in response
      to their despairing questions. Thus, when they at last reached the
      factory, they doubted no longer, their child was dead. Work had just been
      stopped, and they recalled their visit to the place on the morrow of
      Maurice&rsquo;s death. They were returning to the same stillness, the same
      grave-like silence. All the rumbling life had suddenly ceased, the
      machines were cold and mute, the workshops darkened and deserted. Not a
      sound remained, not a soul, not a puff of that steam which was like the
      very breath of the place. He who had watched over its work was dead, and
      it was dead like him. Then their affright increased when they passed from
      the factory to the house amid that absolute solitude, the gallery steeped
      in slumber, the staircase quivering, all the doors upstairs open, as in
      some uninhabited place long since deserted. In the ante-room they found no
      servant. And it was indeed in the same tragedy of sudden death that they
      again participated, only this time it was their own son whom they were to
      find in the same room, on the same bed, frigid, pale, and lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise had just expired. Boutan was there at the head of the bed, holding
      the inanimate hand in which the final pulsation of blood was dying away.
      And when he saw Mathieu and Marianne, who had instinctively crossed the
      disorderly drawing-room, rushing into that bedchamber whose odor of
      nihility they recognized, he could but murmur in a voice full of sobs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor friends, embrace him; you will yet have a little of his last
      breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That breath had scarce ceased, and the unhappy mother, the unhappy father,
      had already sprung forward, kissing those lips that exhaled the final
      quiver of life, and sobbing and crying their distress aloud. Their Blaise
      was dead. Like Rose, he had died suddenly, a year later, on a day of
      festivity. Their heart wound, scarce closed as yet, opened afresh with a
      tragic rending. Amid their long felicity this was the second time that
      they were thus terribly recalled to human wretchedness; this was the
      second hatchet stroke which fell on the flourishing, healthy, happy
      family. And their fright increased. Had they not yet finished paying their
      accumulated debt to misfortune? Was slow destruction now arriving with
      blow following blow? Already since Rose had quitted them, her bier strewn
      with flowers, they had feared to see their prosperity and fruitfulness
      checked and interrupted now that there was an open breach. And to-day,
      through that bloody breach, their Blaise departed in the most frightful of
      fashions, crushed as it were by the jealous anger of destiny. And now what
      other of their children would be torn away from them on the morrow to pay
      in turn the ransom of their happiness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Marianne long remained sobbing on their knees beside the bed.
      Constance stood a few paces away, silent, with an air of quivering
      desolation. Beauchene, as if to combat that fear of death which made him
      shiver, had a moment previously seated himself at the little writing-table
      formerly used by Maurice, which had been left in the drawing-room like a
      souvenir. And he then strove to draw up a notice to his workpeople, to
      inform them that the factory would remain closed until the day after the
      funeral. He was vainly seeking words when he perceived Denis coming out of
      the bedroom, where he had wept all his tears and set his whole heart in
      the last kiss which he had bestowed on his departed brother. Beauchene
      called him, as if desirous of diverting him from his gloomy thoughts.
      &ldquo;There, sit down here and continue this,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, in her turn entering the drawing-room, heard those words. They
      were virtually the same as the words which her husband had pronounced when
      making Blaise seat himself at that same table of Maurice&rsquo;s, on the day
      when he had given him the place of that poor boy, whose body almost seemed
      to be still lying on the bed in the adjoining room. And she recoiled with
      fright on seeing Denis seated there and writing. Had not Blaise
      resuscitated? Even as she had mistaken the twins one for the other that
      very afternoon on rising from the gay baptismal lunch, so now again she
      saw Blaise in Denis, the pair of them so similar physically that in former
      times their parents had only been able to distinguish them by the
      different color of their eyes. And thus it was as if Blaise returned and
      resumed his place; Blaise, who would possess the works although she had
      killed him. She had made a mistake; dead as he was, he would nevertheless
      have the works. She had killed one of those Froments, but behold another
      was born. When one died his brother filled up the breach. And her crime
      then appeared to her such a useless one, such a stupid one, that she was
      aghast at it, the hair on the nape of her neck standing up, while she
      burst into a cold sweat of fear, and recoiled as from a spectre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a notice for the workpeople,&rdquo; Beauchene repeated. &ldquo;We will have it
      posted at the entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wished to be brave, and, approaching her husband, she said to him:
      &ldquo;Draw it up yourself. Why give Blaise the trouble at such a moment as
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said &ldquo;Blaise&rdquo;; and once more an icy sensation of horror came over
      her. Unconsciously she had heard herself saying yonder, in the ante-room:
      &ldquo;Blaise, where did I put my boa?&rdquo; And it was Denis who had brought it to
      her. Of what use had it been for her to kill Blaise, since Denis was
      there? When death mows down a soldier of life, another is always ready to
      take the vacant post of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a last defeat awaited her. Mathieu and Marianne reappeared, while
      Morange, seized with a need of motion, came and went with an air of
      stupefaction, quite losing his wits amid his dreadful sufferings, those
      awful things which could but unhinge his narrow mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down,&rdquo; stammered Marianne, trying to wipe away her tears and
      to remain erect. &ldquo;I wish to see Charlotte, and prepare and tell her of the
      misfortune. I alone can find the words to say, so that she may not die of
      the shock, circumstanced as she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mathieu, full of anxiety, sought to detain his wife, and spare her
      this fresh trial. &ldquo;No, I beg you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Denis will go, or I will go
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With gentle obstinacy, however, she still went towards the stairs. &ldquo;I am
      the only one who can tell her of it, I assure you&mdash;I shall have
      strength&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all at once she staggered and fainted. It became necessary to lay her
      on a sofa in the drawing-room. And when she recovered consciousness, her
      face remained quite white and distorted, and an attack of nausea came upon
      her. Then, as Constance, with an air of anxious solicitude, rang for her
      maid and sent for her little medicine-chest, Mathieu confessed the truth,
      which hitherto had been kept secret; Marianne, like Charlotte, was <i>enceinte</i>.
      It confused her a little, he said, since she was now three-and-forty years
      old; and so they had not mentioned it. &ldquo;Ah! poor brave wife!&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;She wished to spare our daughter-in-law too great a shock; I trust that
      she herself will not be struck down by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enceinte</i>, good heavens! As Constance heard this, it seemed as if a
      bludgeon were falling on her to make her defeat complete. And so, even if
      she should now let Denis, in his turn, kill himself, another Froment was
      coming who would replace him. There was ever another and another of that
      race&mdash;a swarming of strength, an endless fountain of life, against
      which it became impossible to battle. Amid her stupefaction at finding the
      breach repaired when scarce opened, Constance realized her powerlessness
      and nothingness, childless as she was fated to remain. And she felt
      vanquished, overcome with awe, swept away as it were herself; thrust aside
      by the victorious flow of everlasting Fruitfulness.

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOURTEEN months later there was a festival at Chantebled. Denis, who had
      taken Blaise&rsquo;s place at the factory, was married to Marthe Desvignes. And
      after all the grievous mourning this was the first smile, the bright warm
      sun of springtime, so to say, following severe winter. Mathieu and
      Marianne, hitherto grief-stricken and clad in black, displayed a gayety
      tinged with soft emotion in presence of the sempiternal renewal of life.
      The mother had been willing to don less gloomy a gown, and the father had
      agreed to defer no longer a marriage that had long since been resolved
      upon, and was necessitated by all sorts of considerations. For more than
      two years now Rose had been sleeping in the little cemetery of Janville,
      and for more than a year Blaise had joined her there, beneath flowers
      which were ever fresh. And the souvenir of the dear dead ones, whom they
      all visited, and who had remained alive in all their hearts, was to
      participate in the coming festival. It was as if they themselves had
      decided with their parents that the hour for the espousals had struck, and
      that regret for their loss ought no longer to bar the joy of growth and
      increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis&rsquo;s installation at the Beauchene works in his brother&rsquo;s place had
      come about quite naturally. If he had not gone thither on leaving the
      science school where he had spent three years, it was simply because the
      position was at that time already held by Blaise. All his technical
      studies marked him out for the post. In a single day he had fitted himself
      for it, and he simply had to take up his quarters in the little pavilion,
      Charlotte having fled to Chantebled with her little Berthe directly after
      the horrible catastrophe. It should be added that Denis&rsquo; entry into the
      establishment offered a convenient solution with regard to the large sum
      of money lent to Beauchene, which, it had been arranged, should be
      reimbursed by a sixth share in the factory. That money came from the
      family, and one brother simply took the place of the other, signing the
      agreement which the deceased would have signed. With a delicate rectitude,
      however, Denis insisted that out of his share of the profits an annuity
      should be assigned to Charlotte, his brother&rsquo;s widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus matters were settled in a week, in the manner that circumstances
      logically demanded, and without possibility of discussion. Constance,
      bewildered and overwhelmed, was not even able to struggle. Her husband
      reduced her to silence by repeating: &ldquo;What would you have me do? I must
      have somebody to help me, and it is just as well to take Denis as a
      stranger. Besides, if he worries me I will buy him out within a year and
      give him his dismissal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Constance remained silent to avoid casting his ignominy in his
      face, amid her despair at feeling the walls of the house crumble and fall,
      bit by bit, upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once installed at the works, Denis considered that the time had come to
      carry out the matrimonial plans which he had long since arranged with
      Marthe Desvignes. The latter, Charlotte&rsquo;s younger sister and at one time
      the inseparable friend of Rose, had been waiting for him for nearly three
      years now, with her bright smile and air of affectionate good sense. They
      had known one another since childhood, and had exchanged many a vow along
      the lonely paths of Janville. But they had said to one another that they
      would do nothing prematurely, that for the happiness of a whole lifetime
      one might well wait until one was old enough and strong enough to
      undertake family duties. Some people were greatly astonished that a young
      man whose future was so promising, and whose position at twenty-six years
      of age was already a superb one, should thus obstinately espouse a
      penniless girl. Mathieu and Marianne smiled, however, and consented,
      knowing their son&rsquo;s good reasons. He had no desire to marry a rich girl
      who would cost him more than she brought, and he was delighted at having
      discovered a pretty, healthy, and very sensible and skilful young woman,
      who would be at all times his companion, helpmate, and consoler. He feared
      no surprises with her, for he had studied her; she united charm and good
      sense with kindliness, all that was requisite for the happiness of a
      household. And he himself was very good-natured, prudent, and sensible,
      and she knew it and willingly took his arm to tread life&rsquo;s path with him,
      certain as she felt that they would thus walk on together until life&rsquo;s end
      should be reached, ever advancing with the same tranquil step under the
      divine and limpid sun of reason merged in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great preparations were made at Chantebled on the day before the wedding.
      Nevertheless, the ceremony was to remain of an intimate character, on
      account of the recent mourning. The only guests, apart from members of the
      family, were the Seguins and the Beauchenes, and even the latter were
      cousins. So there would scarcely be more than a score of them altogether,
      and only a lunch was to be given. One matter which gave them some brief
      concern was to decide where to set the table, and how to decorate it.
      Those early days of July were so bright and warm that they resolved to
      place it out of doors under the trees. There was a fitting and delightful
      spot in front of the old shooting-box, the primitive pavilion, which had
      been their first residence on their arrival in the Janville district. That
      pavilion was indeed like the family nest, the hearth whence it had
      radiated over the surrounding region. As the pavilion had threatened ruin,
      Mathieu had repaired and enlarged it with the idea of retiring thither
      with Marianne, and Charlotte and her children, as soon as he should cede
      the farm to his son Gervais, that being his intention. He was, indeed,
      pleased with the idea of living in retirement like a patriarch, like a
      king who had willingly abdicated, but whose wise counsel was still sought
      and accepted. In place of the former wild garden a large lawn now
      stretched before the pavilion, surrounded by some beautiful trees, elms
      and hornbeams. These Mathieu had planted, and he had watched them grow;
      thus they seemed to him to be almost part of his flesh. But his real
      favorite was an oak tree, nearly twenty years of age and already sturdy,
      which stood in the centre of the lawn, where he had planted it with
      Marianne, who had held the slender sapling in position while he plied his
      spade on the day when they had founded their domain of Chantebled. And
      near this oak, which thus belonged to their robust family, there was a
      basin of living water, fed by the captured springs of the plateau&mdash;water
      whose crystalline song made the spot one of continual joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here then that a council was held on the day before the wedding.
      Mathieu and Marianne repaired thither to see what preparations would be
      necessary, and they found Charlotte with a sketch-book on her knees,
      rapidly finishing an impression of the oak tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that&mdash;a surprise?&rdquo; they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled with some confusion. &ldquo;Yes, yes, a surprise; you will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she confessed that for a fortnight past she had been designing in
      water colors a series of menu cards for the wedding feast. And, prettily
      and lovingly enough, her idea had been to depict children&rsquo;s games and
      children&rsquo;s heads; indeed, all the members of the family in their childish
      days. She had taken their likenesses from old photographs, and her sketch
      of the oak tree was to serve as a background for the portraits of the two
      youngest scions of the house&mdash;little Benjamin and little Guillaume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Marianne were delighted with that fleet procession of little
      faces all white and pink which they perfectly recognized as they saw them
      pass before their eyes. There were the twins nestling in their cradle,
      locked in one another&rsquo;s arms; there was Rose, the dear lost one, in her
      little shift; there were Ambroise and Gervais, bare, and wrestling on a
      patch of grass; there were Gregoire and Nicolas birdnesting; there were
      Claire and the three other girls, Louise, Madeleine, and Marguerite,
      romping about the farm, quarrelling with the fowls, springing upon the
      horses&rsquo; backs. But what particularly touched Marianne was the sketch of
      her last-born, little Benjamin, now nine months old, whom Charlotte had
      depicted reclining under the oak tree in the same little carriage as her
      own son Guillaume, who was virtually of the same age, having been born but
      eight days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The uncle and the nephew,&rdquo; said Mathieu jestingly. &ldquo;All the same, the
      uncle is the elder by a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Marianne stood there smiling, soft tears came into her eyes, and the
      sketch shook in her happy hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dears!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;my son and grandson. With those dear little ones I
      am once again a mother and a grandmother. Ah, yes! those two are the
      supreme consolation; they have helped to heal the wound; it is they who
      have brought us back hope and courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was true. How overwhelming had been the mourning and sadness of the
      early days when Charlotte, fleeing the factory, had sought refuge at the
      farm! The tragedy by which Blaise had been carried off had nearly killed
      her. Her first solace was to see that her daughter Berthe, who had been
      rather sickly in Paris, regained bright rosy cheeks amid the open air of
      Chantebled. Moreover, she had settled her life: she would spend her
      remaining years, in that hospitable house, devoting herself to her two
      children, and happy in having so affectionate a grandmother and
      grandfather to help and sustain her. She had always shown herself to be
      somewhat apart from life, possessed of a dreamy nature, only asking to
      love and to be loved in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      So by degrees she settled down once more, installed beside her
      grandparents in the old pavilion, which Mathieu fitted up for the three of
      them. And wishing to occupy herself, irrespective of her income from the
      factory, she even set to work again and painted miniatures, which a dealer
      in Paris readily purchased. But her grief was mostly healed by her little
      Guillaume, that child bequeathed to her by her dead husband, in whom he
      resuscitated. And it was much the same with Marianne since the birth of
      Benjamin. A new son had replaced the one she had lost, and helped to fill
      the void in her heart. The two women, the two mothers, found infinite
      solace in nursing those babes. For them they forgot themselves; they
      reared them together, watching them grow side by side; they gave them the
      breast at the same hours, and it was their desire to see them both become
      very strong, very handsome, and very good. Although one mother was almost
      twice as old as the other, they became, as it were, sisters. The same
      nourishing milk flowed from both their fruitful bosoms. And gleams of
      light penetrated their mourning: they began to laugh when they saw those
      little cherubs laugh, and nothing could have been gayer than the sight of
      that mother-in-law and that daughter-in-law side by side, almost mingling,
      having but one cradle between them, amid an unceasing florescence of
      maternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Mathieu suddenly said to Charlotte; &ldquo;hide your drawings,
      here are Gervais and Claire coming about the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gervais at nineteen years of age was quite a colossus, the tallest and the
      strongest of the family, with short, curly black hair, large bright eyes,
      and a full broad-featured face. He had remained his father&rsquo;s favorite son,
      the son of the fertile earth, the one in whom Mathieu fostered a love for
      the estate, a passion for skilful agriculture, in order that later on the
      young man might continue the good work which had been begun. Mathieu
      already disburdened himself on Gervais of a part of his duties, and was
      only waiting to see him married to give him the control of the whole farm.
      And he often thought of adjoining to him Claire when she found a husband
      in some worthy, sturdy fellow who would assume part of the labor. Two men
      agreeing well would be none too many for an enterprise which was
      increasing in importance every day. Since Marianne had again been nursing,
      Claire had been attending to her work. Though she had no beauty, she was
      of vigorous health and quite strong for her seventeen years. She busied
      herself more particularly with cookery and household affairs, but she also
      kept the accounts, being shrewd-witted and very economically inclined, on
      which account the prodigals of the family often made fun of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it&rsquo;s here that the table is to be set,&rdquo; said Gervais; &ldquo;I shall
      have to see that the lawn is mowed then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On her side Claire inquired what number of people there would be at table
      and how she had better place them. Then, Gervais having called to Frederic
      to bring a scythe, the three of them went on discussing the arrangements.
      After Rose&rsquo;s death, Frederic, her betrothed, had continued working beside
      Gervais, becoming his most active and intelligent comrade and helper. For
      some months, too, Marianne and Mathieu had noticed that he was revolving
      around Claire, as though, since he had lost the elder girl, he were
      willing to content himself with the younger one, who was far less
      beautiful no doubt, but withal a good and sturdy housewife. This had at
      first saddened the parents. Was it possible to forget their dear daughter?
      Then, however, they felt moved, for the thought came to them that the
      family ties would be drawn yet closer, that the young fellow&rsquo;s heart would
      not roam in search of love elsewhere, but would remain with them. So
      closing their eyes to what went on, they smiled, for in Frederic, when
      Claire should be old enough to marry, Gervais would find the
      brother-in-law and partner that he needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of the table had just been settled when a sudden invasion
      burst through the tall grass around the oak tree; skirts flew about, and
      loose hair waved in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Louise, &ldquo;there are no roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; repeated Madeleine, &ldquo;not a single white rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Marguerite, &ldquo;we have inspected all the bushes. There are no
      white roses, only red ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen, eleven, and nine, such were their respective ages. Louise, plump
      and gay, already looked a little woman; Madeleine, slim and pretty, spent
      hours at her piano, her eyes full of dreaminess; Marguerite, whose nose
      was rather too large and whose lips were thick, had beautiful golden hair.
      She would pick up little birds at winter time and warm them with her
      hands. And the three of, them, after scouring the back garden, where
      flowers mingled with vegetables, had now rushed up in despair at their
      vain search. No white roses for a wedding! That was the end of everything!
      What could they offer to the bride? And what could they set upon the
      table?
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the three girls, however, appeared Gregoire, with jeering mien, and
      his hands in his pockets. At fifteen he was very malicious, the most
      turbulent, worrying member of the family, a lad inclined to the most
      diabolical devices. His pointed nose and his thin lips denoted also his
      adventurous spirit, his will power, and his skill in effecting his object.
      And, apparently much amused by his sisters&rsquo; disappointment, he forgot
      himself and exclaimed, by way of teasing them: &ldquo;Why, I know where there
      are some white roses, and fine ones, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo; asked Mathieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at the mill, near the wheel, in the little enclosure. There are
      three big bushes which are quite white, with roses as big as cabbages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he flushed and became confused, for his father was eyeing him
      severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you still prowl round the mill?&rdquo; said Mathieu. &ldquo;I had forbidden
      you to do so. As you know that there are white roses in the enclosure you
      must have gone in, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I looked over the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You climbed up the wall, that&rsquo;s the finishing touch! So you want to land
      me in trouble with those Lepailleurs, who are decidedly very foolish and
      very malicious people. There is really a devil in you, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That which Gregoire left unsaid was that he repaired to the enclosure in
      order that he might there join Therese, the miller&rsquo;s fair-haired daughter
      with the droll, laughing face, who was also a terribly adventurous damsel
      for her thirteen years. True, their meetings were but childish play, but
      at the end of the enclosure, under the apple trees, there was a delightful
      nook where one could laugh and chat and amuse oneself at one&rsquo;s ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just listen to me,&rdquo; Mathieu resumed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you going to
      play with Therese again. She is a pretty little girl, no doubt. But that
      house is not a place for you to go to. It seems that they fight one
      another there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a fact. When that young scamp Antonin had recovered his health,
      he had been tormented by a longing to return to Paris, and had done all he
      could with that object, in view of resuming a life of idleness and
      dissipation. Lepailleur, greatly irritated at having been duped by his
      son, had at first violently opposed his plans. But what could he do in the
      country with that idle fellow, whom he himself had taught to hate the
      earth and to sneer at the old rotting mill. Besides, he now had his wife
      against him. She was ever admiring her son&rsquo;s learning, and so stubborn was
      her faith in him that she was convinced that he would this time secure a
      good position in the capital. Thus the father had been obliged to give
      way, and Antonin was now finally wrecking his life while filling some
      petty employment at a merchant&rsquo;s in the Rue du Mail. But, on the other
      hand, the quarrelling increased in the home, particularly whenever
      Lepailleur suspected his wife of robbing him in order to send money to
      that big lazybones, their son. From the bridge over the Yeuse on certain
      days one could hear oaths and blows flying about. And here again was
      family life destroyed, strength wasted, and happiness spoilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried off by perfect anger, Mathieu continued: &ldquo;To think of it; people
      who had everything needful to be happy! How can one be so stupid? How can
      one seek wretchedness for oneself with such obstinacy? As for that idea of
      theirs of an only son, and their vanity in wanting to make a gentleman of
      him, ah! well, they have succeeded finely! They must be extremely pleased
      to-day! It is just like Lepailleur&rsquo;s hatred of the earth, his
      old-fashioned system of cultivation, his obstinacy in leaving his bit of
      moorland barren and refusing to sell it to me, no doubt by way of
      protesting against our success! Can you imagine anything so stupid? And
      it&rsquo;s just like his mill; all folly and idleness he stands still, looking
      at it fall into ruins. He at least had a reason for that in former times;
      he used to say that as the region had almost renounced corn-growing, the
      peasants did not bring him enough grain to set his mill-stones working.
      But nowadays when, thanks to us, corn overflows on all sides, surely he
      ought to have pulled down his old wheel and have replaced it by a good
      engine. Ah! if I were in his place I would already have a new and bigger
      mill there, making all use of the water of the Yeuse, and connecting it
      with Janville railway station by a line of rails, which would not cost so
      much to lay down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregoire stood listening, well pleased that the storm should fall on
      another than himself. And Marianne, seeing that her three daughters were
      still greatly grieved at having no white roses, consoled them, saying:
      &ldquo;Well, for the table to-morrow morning you must gather those which are the
      lightest in color&mdash;the pale pink ones; they will do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Mathieu, calming down, made the children laugh, by adding gayly:
      &ldquo;Gather the red ones too, the reddest you find. They will symbolize the
      blood of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne and Charlotte were still lingering there talking of all the
      preparations, when other little feet came tripping through the grass.
      Nicolas, quite proud of his seven years, was leading his niece Berthe, a
      big girl of six. They agreed very well together. That day they had
      remained indoors playing at &ldquo;fathers and mothers&rdquo; near the cradle occupied
      by Benjamin and Guillaume, whom they called their babies. But all at once
      the infants had awoke, clamoring for nourishment. And Nicolas and Berthe,
      quite alarmed, had thereupon run off to fetch the two mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; called Nicolas, &ldquo;Benjamin&rsquo;s asking for you. He&rsquo;s thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo; repeated Berthe, &ldquo;Guillaume&rsquo;s thirsty. Come quick, he&rsquo;s in
      a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne and Charlotte laughed. True enough, the morrow&rsquo;s wedding had made
      them forget their pets; and so they hastily returned to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day those happy nuptials were celebrated in affectionate
      intimacy. There were but one-and-twenty at table under the oak tree in the
      middle of the lawn, which, girt with elms and hornbeams, seemed like a
      hall of verdure. The whole family was present: first those of the farm,
      then Denis the bridegroom, next Ambroise and his wife Andree, who had
      brought their little Leonce with them. And apart from the family proper,
      there were only the few invited relatives, Beauchene and Constance, Seguin
      and Valentine, with, of course, Madame Desvignes, the bride&rsquo;s mother.
      There were twenty-one at table, as has been said; but besides those
      one-and-twenty there were three very little ones present: Leonce, who at
      fifteen months had just been weaned, and Benjamin and Guillaume, who still
      took the breast. Their little carriages had been drawn up near, so that
      they also belonged to the party, which was thus a round two dozen. And the
      table, flowery with roses, sent forth a delightful perfume under the rain
      of summer sunbeams which flecked it with gold athwart the cool shady
      foliage. From one horizon to the other stretched the wondrous tent of
      azure of the triumphant July sky. And Marthe&rsquo;s white bridal gown, and the
      bright dresses of the girls, big and little; all those gay frocks, and all
      that fine youthful health, seemed like the very florescence of that green
      nook of happiness. They lunched joyously, and ended by clinking glasses in
      country fashion, while wishing all sorts of prosperity to the bridal pair
      and to everybody present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the servants were removing the cloth, Seguin, who affected an
      interest in horse-breeding and cattle-raising, wished Mathieu to show him
      his stables. He had talked nothing but horseflesh during the meal, and was
      particularly desirous of seeing some big farm-horses, whose great strength
      had been praised by his host. He persuaded Beauchene to join him in the
      inspection, and the three men were starting, when Constance and Valentine,
      somewhat inquisitive with respect to that farm, the great growth of which
      still filled them with stupefaction, decided to follow, leaving the rest
      of the family installed under the trees, amid the smiling peacefulness of
      that fine afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow-houses and stables were on the right hand. But in order to reach
      them one had to cross the great yard, whence the entire estate could be
      seen. And here there was a halt, a sudden stopping inspired by admiration,
      so grandly did the work accomplished show forth under the sun. They had
      known that land dry and sterile, covered with mere scrub; they beheld it
      now one sea of waving corn, of crops whose growth increased at each
      successive season. Up yonder, on the old marshy plateau, the fertility was
      such, thanks to the humus amassed during long centuries, that Mathieu did
      not even manure the ground as yet. Then, to right and to left, the former
      sandy slopes spread out all greenery, fertilized by the springs which ever
      brought them increase of fruitfulness. And the very woods afar off,
      skilfully arranged, aired by broad clearings, seemed to possess more sap,
      as if all the surrounding growth of life had instilled additional vigor
      into them. With this vigor, this power, indeed, the whole domain was
      instinct; it was creation, man&rsquo;s labor fertilizing sterile soil, and
      drawing from it a wealth of nourishment for expanding humanity, the
      conqueror of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long spell of silence. At last Seguin, in his dry shrill
      voice, with a tinge of bitterness born of his own ruin, remarked: &ldquo;You
      have done a good stroke of business. I should never have believed it
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they walked on again. But in the sheds, the cow-houses, the
      sheep-cotes, and all round, the sensation of strength and power yet
      increased. Creation was there continuing; the cattle, the sheep, the
      fowls, the rabbits, all that dwelt and swarmed there were incessantly
      increasing and multiplying. Each year the ark became too small, and fresh
      pens and fresh buildings were required. Life increased life; on all sides
      there were fresh broods, fresh flocks, fresh herds; all the conquering
      wealth of inexhaustible fruitfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the stables Seguin greatly admired the big draught
      horses, and praised them with the expressions of a connoisseur. Then he
      returned to the subject of breeding, and cited some extraordinary results
      that one of his friends obtained by certain crosses. So far as the animal
      kingdom was concerned his ideas were sound enough, but when he came to the
      consideration of human kind he was as erratic as ever. As they walked back
      from the stables he began to descant on the population question,
      denouncing the century, and repeating all his old theories. Perhaps it was
      jealous rancor that impelled him to protest against the victory of life
      which the whole farm around him proclaimed so loudly. Depopulation! why,
      it did not extend fast enough. Paris, which wished to die, so people said,
      was really taking its time about it. All the same, he noticed some good
      symptoms, for bankruptcy was increasing on all sides&mdash;in science,
      politics, literature, and even art. Liberty was already dead. Democracy,
      by exasperating ambitious instincts and setting classes in conflict for
      power, was rapidly leading to a social collapse. Only the poor still had
      large families; the elite, the people of wealth and intelligence, had
      fewer and fewer children, so that, before final annihilation came, there
      might still be a last period of acceptable civilization, in which there
      would remain only a few men and women of supreme refinement, content with
      perfumes for sustenance and mere breath for enjoyment. He, however, was
      disgusted, for he now felt certain that he would not see that period since
      it was so slow in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only Christianity would return to the primitive faith,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;and condemn woman as an impure, diabolical, and harmful creature, we
      might go and lead holy lives in the desert, and in that way bring the
      world to an end much sooner. But the political Catholicism of nowadays,
      anxious to keep alive itself, allows and regulates marriage, with the view
      of maintaining things as they are. Oh! you will say, of course, that I
      myself married and that I have children, which is true; but I am pleased
      to think that they will redeem my fault. Gaston says that a soldier&rsquo;s only
      wife ought to be his sword, and so he intends to remain single; and as
      Lucie, on her side, has taken the veil at the Ursulines, I feel quite at
      ease. My race is, so to say, already extinct, and that delights me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu listened with a smile. He was acquainted with that more or less
      literary form of pessimism. In former days all such views, as, for
      instance, the struggle of civilization against the birth-rate, and the
      relative childlessness of the most intelligent and able members of the
      community, had disturbed him. But since he had fought the cause of love he
      had found another faith. Thus he contented himself with saying rather
      maliciously: &ldquo;But you forget your daughter Andree and her little boy
      Leonce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Andree!&rdquo; replied Seguin, waving his hand as if she did not belong to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, however, had stopped short, gazing at him fixedly. Since their
      household had been wrecked and they had been leading lives apart, she no
      longer tolerated his sudden attacks of insane brutality and jealousy. By
      reason also of the squandering of their fortune she had a hold on him, for
      he feared that she might ask for certain accounts to be rendered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he granted, &ldquo;there is Andree; but then girls don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking on again when Beauchene, who had hitherto contented
      himself with puffing and chewing his cigar, for reserve was imposed upon
      him by the frightful drama of his own family life, was unable to remain
      silent any longer. Forgetful, relapsing into the extraordinary
      unconsciousness which always set him erect, like a victorious superior
      man, he spoke out loudly and boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to Seguin&rsquo;s school, but, all the same, he says some true
      things. That population question greatly interests me even now, and I can
      flatter myself that I know it fully. Well, it is evident that Malthus was
      right. It is not allowable for people to have families without knowing how
      they will be able to nourish them. If the poor die of starvation it is
      their fault, and not ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he reverted to his usual lecture on the subject. The governing
      classes alone were reasonable in keeping to small families. A country
      could only produce a certain supply of food, and was therefore restricted
      to a certain population. People talked of the faulty division of wealth;
      but it was madness to dream of an Utopia, where there would be no more
      masters but only so many brothers, equal workers and sharers, who would
      apportion happiness among themselves like a birthday-cake. All the evil
      then came from the lack of foresight among the poor, though with brutal
      frankness he admitted that employers readily availed themselves of the
      circumstance that there was a surplus of children to hire labor at reduced
      rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, losing all recollection of the past, infatuated, intoxicated with
      his own ideas, he went on talking of himself. &ldquo;People pretend that we are
      not patriots because we don&rsquo;t leave troops of children behind us. But that
      is simply ridiculous; each serves the country in his own way. If the poor
      folks give it soldiers, we give it our capital&mdash;all the proceeds of
      our commerce and industry. A fine lot of good would it do the country if
      we were to ruin ourselves with big families, which would hamper us,
      prevent us from getting rich, and afterwards destroy whatever we create by
      subdividing it. With our laws and customs there can be no substantial
      fortune unless a family is limited to one son. And yes, that is necessary;
      but one son&mdash;an only son&mdash;that is the only wise course; therein
      lies the only possible happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It became so painful to hear him, in his position, speaking in that
      fashion, that the others remained silent, full of embarrassment. And he,
      thinking that he was convincing them, went on triumphantly: &ldquo;Thus, I
      myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment Constance interrupted him. She had hitherto walked on
      with bowed head amid that flow of chatter which brought her so much
      torture and shame, an aggravation, as it were, of her defeat. But now she
      raised her face, down which two big tears were trickling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandre!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not yet understand. But on seeing her tears, he ended by feeling
      disturbed, in spite of all his fine assurance. He looked at the others,
      and wishing to have the last word, he added: &ldquo;Ah, yes! our poor child. But
      particular cases have nothing to do with general theories; ideas are still
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell between them. They were now near the lawn where the family
      had remained. And for the last moment Mathieu had been thinking of
      Morange, whom he had also invited to the wedding, but who had excused
      himself from attending, as if he were terrified at the idea of gazing on
      the joy of others, and dreaded, too, lest some sacrilegious attempt should
      be made in his absence on the mysterious sanctuary where he worshipped.
      Would he, Morange&mdash;so Mathieu wondered&mdash;have clung like
      Beauchene to his former ideas? Would he still have defended the theory of
      the only child; that hateful, calculating theory which had cost him both
      his wife and his daughter? Mathieu could picture him flitting past, pale
      and distracted, with the step of a maniac hastening to some mysterious
      end, in which insanity would doubtless have its place. But the lugubrious
      vision vanished, and then again before Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes the lawn spread out
      under the joyous sun, offering between its belt of foliage such a picture
      of happy health and triumphant beauty, that he felt impelled to break the
      mournful silence and exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there! look there! Isn&rsquo;t that gay; isn&rsquo;t that a delightful scene&mdash;all
      those dear women and dear children in that setting of verdure? It ought to
      be painted to show people how healthy and beautiful life is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time had not been lost on the lawn since the Beauchenes and Seguins had
      gone off to visit the stables. First of all there had been a distribution
      of the menu cards, which Charlotte had adorned with such delicate
      water-color sketches. This surprise of hers had enraptured them all at
      lunch, and they still laughed at the sight of those pretty children&rsquo;s
      heads. Then, while the servants cleared the table, Gregoire achieved a
      great success by offering the bride a bouquet of splendid white roses,
      which he drew out of a bush where he had hitherto kept it hidden. He had
      doubtless been waiting for some absence of his father&rsquo;s. They were the
      roses of the mill; with Therese&rsquo;s assistance he must have pillaged the
      bushes in the enclosure. Marianne, recognizing how serious was the
      transgression, wished to scold him. But what superb white roses they were,
      as big as cabbages, as he himself had said! And he was entitled to triumph
      over them, for they were the only white roses there, and had been secured
      by himself, like the wandering urchin he was with a spice of
      knight-errantry in his composition, quite ready to jump over walls and
      cajole damsels in order to deck a bride with snowy blooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! papa won&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; he declared, with no little self-assurance;
      &ldquo;they are far too beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made the others laugh; but fresh emotion ensued, for Benjamin and
      Guillaume awoke and screamed their hunger aloud. It was gayly remarked,
      however, that they were quite entitled to their turn of feasting. And as
      it was simply a family gathering there was no embarrassment on the part of
      the mothers. Marianne took Benjamin on her knees in the shade of the oak
      tree, and Charlotte placed herself with Guillaume on her right hand;
      while, on her left, Andree seated herself with little Leonce, who had been
      weaned a week previously, but was still very fond of caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that the Beauchenes and the Seguins reappeared with
      Mathieu, and stopped short, struck by the charm of the spectacle before
      them. Between a framework of tall trees, under the patriarchal oak, on the
      thick grass of the lawn the whole vigorous family was gathered in a group,
      instinct with gayety, beauty, and strength. Gervais and Claire, ever
      active, were, with Frederic, hurrying on the servants, who made no end of
      serving the coffee on the table which had just been cleared. For this
      table the three younger girls, half buried in a heap of flowers, tea and
      blush and crimson roses, were now, with the help of knight Gregoire,
      devising new decorations. Then, a few paces away, the bridal pair, Denis
      and Marthe, were conversing in undertones; while the bride&rsquo;s mother,
      Madame Desvignes, sat listening to them with a discreet and infinitely
      gentle smile upon her lips. And it was in the midst of all this that
      Marianne, radiant, white of skin, still fresh, ever beautiful, with serene
      strength, was giving the breast to her twelfth child, her Benjamin, and
      smiling at him as he sucked away; while surrendering her other knee to
      little Nicolas, who was jealous of his younger brother. And her two
      daughters-in-law seemed like a continuation of herself. There was Andree
      on the left with Ambroise, who had stepped up to tease his little Leonce;
      and Charlotte on the right with her two children, Guillaume, who hung on
      her breast, and Berthe, who had sought a place among her skirts. And here,
      faith in life had yielded prosperity, ever-increasing, overflowing wealth,
      all the sovereign florescence of happy fruitfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seguin, addressing himself to Marianne, asked her jestingly: &ldquo;And so that
      little gentleman is the fourteenth you have nursed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She likewise laughed. &ldquo;No; I mustn&rsquo;t tell fibs! I have nursed twelve,
      including this one; that is the exact number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauchene, who had recovered his self-possession, could not refrain from
      intervening once more: &ldquo;A full dozen, eh! It is madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I share your opinion,&rdquo; said Mathieu, laughing in his turn. &ldquo;At all
      events, if it is not madness it is extravagance, as we admit, my wife and
      I, when we are alone. And we certainly don&rsquo;t think that all people ought
      to have such large families as ours. But, given the situation in France
      nowadays, with our population dwindling and that of nearly every other
      country increasing, it is hardly possible to complain of even the largest
      family. Thus, even if our example be exaggerated, it remains an example, I
      think, for others to think over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne listened, still smiling, but with tears standing in her eyes. A
      feeling of gentle sadness was penetrating her; her heart-wound had
      reopened even amid all her joy at seeing her children assembled around
      her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she in a trembling voice, &ldquo;there have been twelve, but I
      have only ten left. Two are already sleeping yonder, waiting for us
      underground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign of dread, however, in that evocation of the peaceful
      little cemetery of Janville and the family grave in which all the children
      hoped some day to be laid, one after the other, side by side. Rather did
      that evocation, coming amid that gay wedding assembly, seem like a promise
      of future blessed peace. The memory of the dear departed ones remained
      alive, and lent to one and all a kind of loving gravity even amid their
      mirth. Was it not impossible to accept life without accepting death. Each
      came here to perform his task, and then, his work ended, went to join his
      elders in that slumber of eternity where the great fraternity of humankind
      was fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in presence of those jesters, Beauchene and Seguin, quite a flood of
      words rose to Mathieu&rsquo;s lips. He would have liked to answer them; he would
      have liked to triumph over the mendacious theories which they still dared
      to assert even in their hour of defeat. To fear that the earth might
      become over-populated, that excess of life might produce famine, was this
      not idiotic? Others only had to do as he had done: create the necessary
      subsistence each time that a child was born to them. And he would have
      pointed to Chantebled, his work, and to all the corn growing up under the
      sun, even as his children grew. They could not be charged with having come
      to consume the share of others, since each was born with his bread before
      him. And millions of new beings might follow, for the earth was vast: more
      than two-thirds of it still remained to be placed under cultivation, and
      therein lay endless fertility for unlimited humanity. Besides, had not
      every civilization, every progress, been due to the impulse of numbers?
      The improvidence of the poor had alone urged revolutionary multitudes to
      the conquest of truth, justice, and happiness. And with each succeeding
      day the human torrent would require more kindliness, more equity, the
      logical division of wealth by just laws regulating universal labor. If it
      were true, too, that civilization was a check to excessive natality, this
      phenomenon itself might make one hope in final equilibrium in the far-off
      ages, when the earth should be entirely populated and wise enough to live
      in a sort of divine immobility. But all this was pure speculation beside
      the needs of the hour, the nations which must be built up afresh and
      incessantly enlarged, pending the eventual definitive federation of
      mankind. And it was really an example, a brave and a necessary one, that
      Marianne and he were giving, in order that manners and customs, and the
      idea of morality and the idea of beauty might be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of these thoughts Mathieu was already opening his mouth to speak. But
      all at once he felt how futile discussion would be in presence of that
      admirable scene; that mother surrounded by such a florescence of vigorous
      children; that mother nursing yet another child, under the big oak which
      she had planted. She was bravely accomplishing her task&mdash;that of
      perpetuating the world. And hers was the sovereign beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu could think of only one thing that would express everything, and
      that was to kiss her with all his heart before the whole assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, dear wife! You are the most beautiful and the best! May all the
      others do as you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, when Marianne had gloriously returned his kiss, there arose an
      acclamation, a tempest of merry laughter. They were both of heroic mould;
      it was with a great dash of heroism that they had steered their bark
      onward, thanks to their full faith in life, their will of action, and the
      force of their love. And Constance was at last conscious of it: she could
      realize the conquering power of fruitfulness; she could already see the
      Froments masters of the factory through their son Denis; masters of
      Seguin&rsquo;s mansion through their son Ambroise; masters, too, of all the
      countryside through their other children. Numbers spelt victory. And
      shrinking, consumed with a love which she could never more satisfy, full
      of the bitterness of her defeat, though she yet hoped for some abominable
      revenge of destiny, she&mdash;who never wept!&mdash;turned aside to hide
      the big hot tears which now burnt her withered cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Benjamin and Guillaume were enjoying themselves like greedy
      little men whom nothing could disturb. Had there been less laughter one
      might have heard the trickling of their mothers&rsquo; milk: that little stream
      flowing forth amid the torrent of sap which upraised the earth and made
      the big trees quiver in the powerful July blaze. On every side fruitful
      life was conveying germs, creating and nourishing. And for its eternal
      work an eternal river of milk flowed through the world.

    <h2>
      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE Sunday morning Norine and Cecile&mdash;who, though it was rightly a
      day of rest, were, nevertheless, working on either side of their little
      table, pressed as they were to deliver boxes for the approaching New Year
      season&mdash;received a visit which left them pale with stupor and fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their unknown hidden life had hitherto followed a peaceful course, the
      only battle being to make both ends meet every week, and to put by the
      rent money for payment every quarter. During the eight years that the
      sisters had been living together in the Rue de la Federation near the
      Champ de Mars, occupying the same big room with cheerful windows, a room
      whose coquettish cleanliness made them feel quite proud, Norine&rsquo;s child
      had grown up steadily between his two affectionate mothers. For he had
      ended by confounding them together: there was Mamma Norine and there was
      Mamma Cecile; and he did not exactly know whether one of the two was more
      his mother than the other. It was for him alone that they both lived and
      toiled, the one still a fine, good-looking woman at forty years of age,
      the other yet girlish at thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at about ten o&rsquo;clock that Sunday, there came in succession two loud
      knocks at the door. When the latter was opened a short, thick-set fellow,
      about eighteen, stepped in. He was dark-haired, with a square face, a hard
      prominent jaw, and eyes of a pale gray. And he wore a ragged old jacket
      and a gray cloth cap, discolored by long usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t it here that live Mesdames Moineaud, who
      make cardboard boxes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine stood there looking at him with sudden uneasiness. Her heart had
      contracted as if she were menaced. She had certainly seen that face
      somewhere before; but she could only recall one old-time danger, which
      suddenly seemed to revive, more formidable than ever, as if threatening to
      spoil her quiet life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is here,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any haste the young man glanced around the room. He must have
      expected more signs of means than he found, for he pouted slightly. Then
      his eyes rested on the child, who, like a well-behaved little boy, had
      been amusing himself with reading, and had now raised his face to examine
      the newcomer. And the latter concluded his examination by directing a
      brief glance at the other woman who was present, a slight, sickly creature
      who likewise felt anxious in presence of that sudden apparition of the
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told the left-hand door on the fourth floor,&rdquo; the young man
      resumed. &ldquo;But, all the same, I was afraid of making a mistake, for the
      things I have to say can&rsquo;t be said to everybody. It isn&rsquo;t an easy matter,
      and, of course, I thought it well over before I came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke slowly in a drawling way, and after again making sure that the
      other woman was too young to be the one he sought, he kept his pale eyes
      steadily fixed on Norine. The growing anguish with which he saw her
      quivering, the appeal that she was evidently making to her memory, induced
      him to prolong things for another moment. Then he spoke out: &ldquo;I am the
      child who was put to nurse at Rougemont; my name is Alexandre-Honore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for him to say anything more. The unhappy Norine began
      to tremble from head to foot, clasped and wrung her hands, while an ashen
      hue came over her distorted features. Good heavens&mdash;Beauchene! Yes,
      it was Beauchene whom he resembled, and in so striking a manner, with his
      eyes of prey, his big jaw which proclaimed an enjoyer consumed by base
      voracity, that she was now astonished that she had not been able to name
      him at her first glance. Her legs failed her, and she had to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; said Alexandre.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she continued shivering, confessing the truth by her manner, but unable
      to articulate a word, to such a point did despair and fright clutch her at
      the throat, he felt the need of reassuring her a little, particularly if
      he was to keep that door open to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not upset yourself like that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you have nothing to
      fear from me; it isn&rsquo;t my intention to give you any trouble. Only when I
      learnt at last where you were I wished to know you, and that was natural,
      wasn&rsquo;t it? I even fancied that perhaps you might be pleased to see me.. ..
      Then, too, the truth is that I&rsquo;m precious badly off. Three years ago I was
      silly enough to come back to Paris, where I do little more than starve.
      And on the days when one hasn&rsquo;t breakfasted, one feels inclined to look up
      one&rsquo;s parents, even though they may have turned one into the street, for,
      all the same, they can hardly be so hard-hearted as to refuse one a
      plateful of soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears rose to Norine&rsquo;s eyes. This was the finishing stroke, the return of
      that wretched cast-off son, that big suspicious-looking fellow who accused
      her and complained of starving. Annoyed at being unable to elicit from her
      any response but shivers and sobs, Alexandre turned to Cecile: &ldquo;You are
      her sister, I know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;tell her that it&rsquo;s stupid of her to go on
      like that. I haven&rsquo;t come to murder her. It&rsquo;s funny how pleased she is to
      see me! Yet I don&rsquo;t make any noise, and I said nothing whatever to the
      door-porter downstairs, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as Cecile, without answering him, rose to go and comfort Norine, he
      again became interested in the child, who likewise felt frightened and
      turned pale on seeing the grief of his two mammas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that lad is my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Norine suddenly sprang to her feet and set herself between the
      child and him. A mad fear had come to her of some catastrophe, some great
      collapse which would crush them all. Yet she did not wish to be harsh, she
      even sought kind words, but amid it all she lost her head, carried away by
      feelings of revolt, rancor, instinctive hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came, I can understand it. But it is so cruel. What can I do? After
      so many years one doesn&rsquo;t know one another, one has nothing to say. And,
      besides, as you can see for yourself, I&rsquo;m not rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexandre glanced round the room for the second time. &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; he
      answered; &ldquo;and my father, can&rsquo;t you tell me his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained thunderstruck by this question and turned yet paler, while he
      continued: &ldquo;Because if my father should have any money I should know very
      well how to make him give me some. People have no right to fling children
      into the gutter like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once Norine had seen the past rise up before her: Beauchene, the
      works, and her father, who now had just quitted them owing to his
      infirmities, leaving his son Victor behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a sort of instinctive prudence came to her at the thought that if she
      were to give up Beauchene&rsquo;s name she might compromise all her happy life,
      since terrible complications might ensue. The dread she felt of that
      suspicious-looking lad, who reeked of idleness and vice, inspired her with
      an idea: &ldquo;Your father? He has long been dead,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have known nothing, have learnt nothing on that point, for, in
      presence of the energy of her answer, he expressed no doubt whatever of
      her veracity, but contented himself with making a rough gesture which
      indicated how angry he felt at seeing his hungry hopes thus destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve got to starve!&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norine, utterly distracted, was possessed by one painful desire&mdash;a
      desire that he might take himself away, and cease torturing her by his
      presence, to such a degree did remorse, and pity, and fright, and horror
      now wring her bleeding heart. She opened a drawer and took from it a
      ten-franc piece, her savings for the last three months, with which she had
      intended to buy a New Year&rsquo;s present for her little boy. And giving those
      ten francs to Alexandre, she said: &ldquo;Listen, I can do nothing for you. We
      live all three in this one room, and we scarcely earn our bread. It
      grieves me very much to know that you are so unfortunately circumstanced.
      But you mustn&rsquo;t rely on me. Do as we do&mdash;work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pocketed the ten francs, and remained there for another moment swaying
      about, and saying that he had not come for money, and that he could very
      well understand things. For his part he always behaved properly with
      people when people behaved properly with him. And he repeated that since
      she showed herself good-natured he had no idea of creating any scandal. A
      mother who did what she could performed her duty, even though she might
      only give a ten-sous piece. Then, as he was at last going off, he
      inquired: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him, but with cold lips and lifeless heart, and the two
      smacking kisses which, with noisy affectation, he gave her in return, left
      her cheeks quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And au revoir, eh?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Although one may be poor and unable to keep
      together, each knows now that the other&rsquo;s in the land of the living. And
      there is no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t come up just now and again to wish you
      good day when I&rsquo;m passing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had at last disappeared long silence fell amid the infinite
      distress which his short stay had brought there. Norine had again sunk
      upon a chair, as if overwhelmed by this catastrophe. Cecile had been
      obliged to sit down in front of her, for she also was overcome. And it was
      she who, amid the mournfulness of that room, which but a little while ago
      had held all their happiness, spoke out the first to complain and express
      her astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did not ask him anything; we know nothing about him,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;Where has he come from? What is he doing? What does he want? And, in
      particular, how did he manage to discover you? These were the interesting
      things to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what would you have!&rdquo; replied Norine. &ldquo;When he told me his name he
      knocked all the strength out of me; I felt as cold as ice! Oh! it&rsquo;s he,
      there&rsquo;s no doubt of it. You recognized his likeness to his father, didn&rsquo;t
      you? But you are right; we know nothing, and now we shall always be living
      with that threat over our heads, in fear that everything will crumble down
      upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All her strength, all her courage was gone, and she began to sob,
      stammering indistinctly: &ldquo;To think of it! a big fellow of eighteen falling
      on one like that without a word of warning! And it&rsquo;s quite true that I
      don&rsquo;t love him, since I don&rsquo;t even know him. When he kissed me I felt
      nothing. I was icy cold, as if my heart were frozen. O God! O God! what
      trouble to be sure, and how horrid and cruel it all is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as her little boy, on seeing her weep, ran up and flung himself;
      frightened and tearful, against her bosom, she wildly caught him in her
      arms. &ldquo;My poor little one! my poor little one! if only you don&rsquo;t suffer by
      it; if only my sin doesn&rsquo;t fall on you! Ah! that would be a terrible
      punishment. Really the best course is for folks to behave properly in life
      if they don&rsquo;t want to have a lot of trouble afterwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the sisters, having grown somewhat calmer, decided that
      their best course would be to write to Mathieu. Norine remembered that he
      had called on her a few years previously to ask if Alexandre had not been
      to see her. He alone knew all the particulars of the business, and where
      to obtain information. And, indeed, as soon as the sisters&rsquo; letter reached
      him Mathieu made haste to call on them in the Rue de la Federation, for he
      was anxious with respect to the effect which any scandal might have at the
      works, where Beauchene&rsquo;s position was becoming worse every day. After
      questioning Norine at length, he guessed that Alexandre must have learnt
      her address through La Couteau, though he could not say precisely how this
      had come about. At last, after a long month of discreet researches,
      conversations with Madame Menoux, Celeste, and La Couteau herself, he was
      able in some measure to explain things. The alert had certainly come from
      the inquiry intrusted to the nurse-agent at Rougemont, that visit which
      she had made to the hamlet of Saint-Pierre in quest of information
      respecting the lad who was supposed to be in apprenticeship with Montoir
      the wheelwright. She had talked too much, said too much, particularly to
      the other apprentice, that Richard, another foundling, and one of such bad
      instincts, too, that seven months later he had taken flight, like
      Alexandre, after purloining some money from his master. Then years
      elapsed, and all trace of them was lost. But later on, most assuredly they
      had met one another on the Paris pavement, in such wise that the big
      carroty lad had told the little dark fellow the whole story how his
      relatives had caused a search to be made for him, and perhaps, too, who
      his mother was, the whole interspersed with tittle-tattle and ridiculous
      inventions. Still this did not explain everything, and to understand how
      Alexandre had procured his mother&rsquo;s actual address, Mathieu had to presume
      that he had secured it from La Couteau, whom Celeste had acquainted with
      so many things. Indeed, he learnt at Broquette&rsquo;s nurse-agency that a
      short, thickset young man with pronounced jaw-bones had come there twice
      to speak to La Couteau. Nevertheless, many points remained unexplained;
      the whole affair had taken place amid the tragic, murky gloom of Parisian
      low life, whose mire it is not healthy to stir. Mathieu ended by resting
      content with a general notion of the business, for he himself felt
      frightened at the charges already hanging over those two young bandits,
      who lived so precariously, dragging their idleness and their vices over
      the pavement of the great city. And thus all his researches had resulted
      in but one consoling certainty, which was that even if Norine the mother
      was known, the father&rsquo;s name and position were certainly not suspected by
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu saw Norine again on the subject he terrified her by the few
      particulars which he was obliged to give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg you, I beg you, do not let him come again,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Find
      some means; prevent him from coming here. It upsets me too dreadfully to
      see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, of course, could do nothing in this respect. After mature
      reflection he realized that the great object of his efforts must be to
      prevent Alexandre from discovering Beauchene. What he had learnt of the
      young man was so bad, so dreadful, that he wished to spare Constance the
      pain and scandal of being blackmailed. He could see her blanching at the
      thought of the ignominy of that lad whom she had so passionately desired
      to find, and he felt ashamed for her sake, and deemed it more
      compassionate and even necessary to bury the secret in the silence of the
      grave. Still, it was only after a long fight with himself that he came to
      this decision, for he felt that it was hard to have to abandon the unhappy
      youth in the streets. Was it still possible to save him? He doubted it.
      And besides, who would undertake the task, who would know how to instil
      honest principles into that waif by teaching him to work? It all meant yet
      another man cast overboard, forsaken amid the tempest, and Mathieu&rsquo;s heart
      bled at the thought of condemning him, though he could think of no
      reasonable means of salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion,&rdquo; he said to Norine, &ldquo;is that you should keep his father&rsquo;s
      name from him for the present. Later on we will see. But just now I should
      fear worry for everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eagerly acquiesced. &ldquo;Oh! you need not be anxious,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;I
      have already told him that his father is dead. If I were to speak out
      everything would fall on my shoulders, and my great desire is to be left
      in peace in my corner with my little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With sorrowful mien Mathieu continued reflecting, unable to make up his
      mind to utterly abandon the young man. &ldquo;If he would only work, I would
      find him some employment. And I would even take him on at the farm later,
      when I should no longer have cause to fear that he might contaminate my
      people. However, I will see what can be done; I know a wheelwright who
      would doubtless employ him, and I will write to you in order that you may
      tell him where to apply, when he comes back to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? When he comes back!&rdquo; she cried in despair. &ldquo;So you think that he
      will come back. O God! O God! I shall never be happy again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did, indeed, come back. But when she gave him the wheelwright&rsquo;s address
      he sneered and shrugged his shoulders. He knew all about the Paris
      wheelwrights! A set of sweaters, a parcel of lazy rogues, who made poor
      people toil and moil for them. Besides, he had never finished his
      apprenticeship; he was only fit for running errands, in which capacity he
      was willing to accept a post in a large shop. When Mathieu had procured
      him such a situation, he did not remain in it a fortnight. One fine
      evening he disappeared with the parcels of goods which he had been told to
      deliver. In turn he tried to learn a baker&rsquo;s calling, became a mason&rsquo;s
      hodman, secured work at the markets, but without ever fixing himself
      anywhere. He simply discouraged his protector, and left all sorts of
      roguery behind him for others to liquidate. It became necessary to
      renounce the hope of saving him. When he turned up, as he did
      periodically, emaciated, hungry, and in rags, they had to limit themselves
      to providing him with the means to buy a jacket and some bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Norine lived on in a state of mortal disquietude. For long weeks
      Alexandre seemed to be dead, but she, nevertheless, started at the
      slightest sound that she heard on the landing. She always felt him to be
      there, and whenever he suddenly rapped on the door she recognized his
      heavy knock and began to tremble as if he had come to beat her. He had
      noticed how his presence reduced the unhappy woman to a state of abject
      terror, and he profited by this to extract from her whatever little sums
      she hid away. When she had handed him the five-franc piece which Mathieu,
      as a rule, left with her for this purpose, the young rascal was not
      content, but began searching for more. At times he made his appearance in
      a wild, haggard state, declaring that he should certainly be sent to
      prison that evening if he did not secure ten francs, and talking the while
      of smashing everything in the room or else of carrying off the little
      clock in order to sell it. And it was then necessary for Cecile to
      intervene and turn him out of the place; for, however puny she might be,
      she had a brave heart. But if he went off it was only to return a few days
      later with fresh demands, threatening that he would shout his story to
      everybody on the stairs if the ten francs were not given to him. One day,
      when his mother had no money in the place and began to weep, he talked of
      ripping up the mattress, where, said he, she probably kept her hoard.
      Briefly, the sisters&rsquo; little home was becoming a perfect hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest misfortune of all, however, was that in the Rue de la
      Federation Alexandre made the acquaintance of Alfred, Norine&rsquo;s youngest
      brother, the last born of the Moineaud family. He was then twenty, and
      thus two years the senior of his nephew. No worse prowler than he existed.
      He was the genuine rough, with pale, beardless face, blinking eyes, and
      twisted mouth, the real gutter-weed that sprouts up amid the Parisian
      manure-heaps. At seven years of age he robbed his sisters, beating Cecile
      every Saturday in order to tear her earnings from her. Mother Moineaud,
      worn out with hard work and unable to exercise a constant watch over him,
      had never managed to make him attend school regularly, or to keep him in
      apprenticeship. He exasperated her to such a degree that she herself ended
      by turning him into the streets in order to secure a little peace and
      quietness at home. His big brothers kicked him about, his father was at
      work from morning till evening, and the child, thus morally a waif, grew
      up out of doors for a career of vice and crime among the swarms of lads
      and girls of his age, who all rotted there together like apples fallen on
      the ground. And as Alfred grew he became yet more corrupt; he was like the
      sacrificed surplus of a poor man&rsquo;s family, the surplus poured into the
      gutter, the spoilt fruit which spoils all that comes into contact with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Alexandre, too, he nowadays only lived chancewise, and it was not
      even known where he had been sleeping, since Mother Moineaud had died at a
      hospital exhausted by her long life of wretchedness and family cares which
      had proved far too heavy for her. She was only sixty at the time of her
      death, but was as bent and as worn out as a centenarian. Moineaud, two
      years older, bent like herself, his legs twisted by paralysis, a
      lamentable wreck after fifty years of unjust toil, had been obliged to
      quit the factory, and thus the home was empty, and its few poor sticks had
      been cast to the four winds of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moineaud fortunately received a little pension, for which he was indebted
      to Denis&rsquo;s compassionate initiative. But he was sinking into second
      childhood, worn out by his long and constant efforts, and not only did he
      squander his few coppers in drink, but he could not be left alone, for his
      feet were lifeless, and his hands shook to such a degree that he ran the
      risk of setting all about him on fire whenever he tried to light his pipe.
      At last he found himself stranded in the home of his daughters, Norine and
      Cecile, the only two who had heart enough to take him in. They rented a
      little closet for him, on the fifth floor of the house, over their own
      room, and they nursed him and bought him food and clothes with his
      pension-money, to which they added a good deal of their own. As they
      remarked in their gay, courageous way, they now had two children, a little
      one and a very old one, which was a heavy burden for two women who earned
      but five francs a day, although they were ever making boxes from morn till
      night, There was a touch of soft irony in the circumstance that old
      Moineaud should have been unable to find any other refuge than the home of
      his daughter Norine&mdash;that daughter whom he had formerly turned away
      and cursed for her misconduct, that hussy who had dishonored him, but
      whose very hands he now kissed when, for fear lest he should set the tip
      of his nose ablaze, she helped him to light his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, the shaky old nest of the Moineauds was destroyed, and the
      whole family had flown off, dispersed chancewise. Irma alone, thanks to
      her fine marriage with a clerk, lived happily, playing the part of a lady,
      and so full of vanity that she no longer condescended to see her brothers
      and sisters. Victor, meantime, was leading at the factory much the same
      life as his father had led, working at the same mill as the other, and in
      the same blind, stubborn way. He had married, and though he was under
      six-and-thirty, he already had six children, three boys and three girls,
      so that his wife seemed fated to much the same existence as his mother La
      Moineaude. Both of them would finish broken down, and their children in
      their turn would unconsciously perpetuate the swarming and accursed
      starveling race.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Euphrasie&rsquo;s, destiny the inevitable showed itself more tragic still.
      The wretched woman had not been lucky enough to die. She had gradually
      become bedridden, quite unable to move, though she lived on and could hear
      and see and understand things. From that open grave, her bed, she had
      beheld the final break-up of what remained of her sorry home. She was
      nothing more than a thing, insulted by her husband and tortured by Madame
      Joseph, who would leave her for days together without water, and fling her
      occasional crusts much as they might be flung to a sick animal whose
      litter is not even changed. Terror-stricken, and full of humility amid her
      downfall, Euphrasie resigned herself to everything; but the worst was that
      her three children, her twin daughters and her son, being abandoned to
      themselves, sank into vice, the all-corrupting life of the streets.
      Benard, tired out, distracted by the wreck of his home, had taken to
      drinking with Madame Joseph; and afterwards they would fight together,
      break the furniture, and drive off the children, who came home muddy, in
      rags, and with their pockets full of stolen things. On two occasions
      Benard disappeared for a week at a time. On the third he did not come back
      at all. When the rent fell due, Madame Joseph in her turn took herself
      off. And then came the end. Euphrasie had to be removed to the hospital of
      La Salpetriere, the last refuge of the aged and the infirm; while the
      children, henceforth without a home in name, were driven into the gutter.
      The boy never turned up again; it was as if he had been swallowed by some
      sewer. One of the twin girls, found in the streets, died in a hospital
      during the ensuing year; and the other, Toinette, a fair-haired scraggy
      hussy, who, however puny she might look, was a terrible little creature
      with the eyes and the teeth of a wolf, lived under the bridges, in the
      depths of the stone quarries, in the dingy garrets of haunts of vice, so
      that at sixteen she was already an expert thief. Her fate was similar to
      Alfred&rsquo;s; here was a girl morally abandoned, then contaminated by the life
      of the streets, and carried off to a criminal career. And, indeed, the
      uncle and the niece having met by chance, ended by consorting together,
      their favorite refuge, it was thought, being the limekilns in the
      direction of Les Moulineaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day then it happened that Alexandre upon calling at Norine&rsquo;s there
      encountered Alfred, who came at times to try to extract a half-franc from
      old Moineaud, his father. The two young bandits went off together,
      chatted, and met again. And from that chance encounter there sprang a
      band. Alexandre was living with Richard, and Alfred brought Toinette to
      them. Thus they were four in number, and the customary developments
      followed: begging at first, the girl putting out her hand at the
      instigation of the three prowlers, who remained on the watch and drew alms
      by force at nighttime from belated bourgeois encountered in dark corners;
      next came vulgar vice and its wonted attendant, blackmail; and then theft,
      petty larceny to begin with, the pilfering of things displayed for sale by
      shopkeepers, and afterwards more serious affairs, premeditated
      expeditions, mapped out like real war plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band slept wherever it could; now in suspicious dingy doss-houses, now
      on waste ground. In summer time there were endless saunters through the
      woods of the environs, pending the arrival of night, which handed Paris
      over to their predatory designs. They found themselves at the Central
      Markets, among the crowds on the boulevards, in the low taverns, along the
      deserted avenues&mdash;indeed, wherever they sniffed the possibility of a
      stroke of luck, the chance of snatching the bread of idleness, or the
      pleasures of vice. They were like a little clan of savages on the war-path
      athwart civilization, living outside the pale of the laws. They suggested
      young wild beasts beating the ancestral forest; they typified the human
      animal relapsing into barbarism, forsaken since birth, and evincing the
      ancient instincts of pillage and carnage. And like noxious weeds they grew
      up sturdily, becoming bolder and bolder each day, exacting a bigger and
      bigger ransom from the fools who toiled and moiled, ever extending their
      thefts and marching along the road to murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never should it be forgotten that the child, born chancewise, and then
      cast upon the pavement, without supervision, without prop or help, rots
      there and becomes a terrible ferment of social decomposition. All those
      little ones thrown to the gutter, like superfluous kittens are flung into
      some sewer, all those forsaken ones, those wanderers of the pavement who
      beg, and thieve, and indulge in vice, form the dung-heap in which the
      worst crimes germinate. Childhood left to wretchedness breeds a fearful
      nucleus of infection in the tragic gloom of the depths of Paris. Those who
      are thus imprudently cast into the streets yield a harvest of brigandage&mdash;that
      frightful harvest of evil which makes all society totter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Norine, through the boasting of Alexandre and Alfred, who took
      pleasure in astonishing her, began to suspect the exploits of the band,
      she felt so frightened that she had a strong bolt placed upon her door.
      And when night had fallen she no longer admitted any visitor until she
      knew his name. Her torture had been lasting for nearly two years; she was
      ever quivering with alarm at the thought of Alexandre rushing in upon her
      some dark night. He was twenty now; he spoke authoritatively, and
      threatened her with atrocious revenge whenever he had to retire with empty
      hands. One day, in spite of Cecile, he threw himself upon the wardrobe and
      carried off a bundle of linen, handkerchiefs, towels, napkins, and sheets,
      intending to sell them. And the sisters did not dare to pursue him down
      the stairs. Despairing, weeping, overwhelmed by it all, they had sunk down
      upon their chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That winter proved a very severe one; and the two poor workwomen, pillaged
      in this fashion, would have perished in their sorry home of cold and
      starvation, together with the dear child for whom they still did their
      best, had it not been for the help which their old friend, Madame Angelin,
      regularly brought them. She was still a lady-delegate of the Poor Relief
      Service, and continued to watch over the children of unhappy mothers in
      that terrible district of Grenelle, whose poverty is so great. But for a
      long time past she had been unable to do anything officially for Norine.
      If she still brought her a twenty-franc piece every month, it was because
      charitable people intrusted her with fairly large amounts, knowing that
      she could distribute them to advantage in the dreadful inferno which her
      functions compelled her to frequent. She set her last joy and found the
      great consolation of her desolate, childless life in thus remitting alms
      to poor mothers whose little ones laughed at her joyously as soon as they
      saw her arrive with her hands full of good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the weather was frightful, all rain and wind, Madame Angelin
      lingered for a little while in Norine&rsquo;s room. It was barely two o&rsquo;clock in
      the afternoon, and she was just beginning her round. On her lap lay her
      little bag, bulging out with the gold and the silver which she had to
      distribute. Old Moineaud was there, installed on a chair and smoking his
      pipe, in front of her. And she felt concerned about his needs, and
      explained that she would have greatly liked to obtain a monthly relief
      allowance for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you only knew,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;what suffering there is among the poor
      during these winter months. We are quite swamped, we cannot give to
      everybody, there are too many. And after all you are among the fortunate
      ones. I find some lying like dogs on the tiled floors of their rooms,
      without a scrap of coal to make a fire or even a potato to eat. And the
      poor children, too, good Heavens! Children in heaps among vermin, without
      shoes, without clothes, all growing up as if destined for prison or the
      scaffold, unless consumption should carry them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Angelin quivered and closed her eyes as if to escape the spectacle
      of all the terrifying things that she evoked, the wretchedness, the shame,
      the crimes that she elbowed during her continual perambulations through
      that hell of poverty, vice, and hunger. She often returned home pale and
      silent, having reached the uttermost depths of human abomination, and
      never daring to say all. At times she trembled and raised her eyes to
      Heaven, wondering what vengeful cataclysm would swallow up that accursed
      city of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she murmured once more; &ldquo;their sufferings are so great, may their
      sins be forgiven them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moineaud listened to her in a state of stupor, as if he were unable to
      understand. At last with difficulty he succeeded in taking his pipe from
      his mouth. It was, indeed, quite an effort now for him to do such a thing,
      and yet for fifty years he had wrestled with iron&mdash;iron in the vice
      or on the anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing like good conduct,&rdquo; he stammered huskily. &ldquo;When a man
      works he&rsquo;s rewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he wished to set his pipe between his lips once more, but was unable
      to do so. His hand, deformed by the constant use of tools, trembled too
      violently. So it became necessary for Norine to rise from her chair and
      help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecile, who had not ceased working, cutting out
      the cardboard for the little boxes she made: &ldquo;What would have become of
      him if we had not given him shelter? It isn&rsquo;t Irma, with her stylish hats
      and her silk dresses who would have cared to have him at her place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Norine&rsquo;s little boy had taken his stand in front of Madame
      Angelin, for he knew very well that, on the days when the good lady
      called, there was some dessert at supper in the evening. He smiled at her
      with the bright eyes which lit up his pretty fair face, crowned with
      tumbled sunshiny hair. And when she noticed with what a merry glance he
      was waiting for her to open her little bag, she felt quite moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and kiss me, my little friend,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew no sweeter reward for all that she did than the kisses of the
      children in the poor homes whither she brought a little joy. When the
      youngster had boldly thrown his arms round her neck, her eyes filled with
      tears; and, addressing herself to his mother, she repeated: &ldquo;No, no, you
      must not complain; there are others who are more unhappy than you. I know
      one who if this pretty little fellow could only be her own would willingly
      accept your poverty, and paste boxes together from morning till night and
      lead a recluse&rsquo;s life in this one room, which he suffices to fill with
      sunshine. Ah! good Heavens, if you were only willing, if we could only
      change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she became silent, afraid that she might burst into sobs. The
      wound dealt her by her childlessness had always remained open. She and her
      husband were now growing old in bitter solitude in three little rooms
      overlooking a courtyard in the Rue de Lille. In this retirement they
      subsisted on the salary which she, the wife, received as a lady-delegate,
      joined to what they had been able to save of their original fortune. The
      former fan-painter of triumphant mien was now completely blind, a mere
      thing, a poor suffering thing, whom his wife seated every morning in an
      armchair where she still found him in the evening when she returned home
      from her incessant peregrinations through the frightful misery of guilty
      mothers and martyred children. He could no longer eat, he could no longer
      go to bed without her help, he had only her left him, he was her child as
      he would say at times with a despairing irony which made them both weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child? Ah, yes! she had ended by having one, and it was he! An old
      child, born of disaster; one who appeared to be eighty though he was less
      than fifty years old, and who amid his black and ceaseless night ever
      dreamt of sunshine during the long hours which he was compelled to spend
      alone. And Madame Angelin did not only envy that poor workwoman her little
      boy, she also envied her that old man smoking his pipe yonder, that infirm
      relic of labor who at all events saw clearly and still lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry the lady,&rdquo; said Norine to her son; for she felt anxious,
      quite moved indeed, at seeing the other so disturbed, with her heart so
      full. &ldquo;Run away and play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had learnt a little of Madame Angelin&rsquo;s sad story from Mathieu. And
      with the deep gratitude which she felt towards her benefactress was
      blended a sort of impassioned respect, which rendered her timid and
      deferent each time that she saw her arrive, tall and distinguished, ever
      clad in black, and showing the remnants of her former beauty which sorrow
      had wrecked already, though she was barely six-and-forty years of age. For
      Norine, the lady-delegate was like some queen who had fallen from her
      throne amid frightful and undeserved sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away, go and play, my darling,&rdquo; Norine repeated to her boy: &ldquo;you are
      tiring madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiring me, oh no!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Angelin, conquering her emotion. &ldquo;On
      the contrary, he does me good. Kiss me, kiss me again, my pretty fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to bestir and collect herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is getting late, and I have so many places to go to between now
      and this evening! This is what I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was at last taking a gold coin from her little bag, but at that very
      moment a heavy blow, as if dealt by a fist, resounded on the door. And
      Norine turned ghastly pale, for she had recognized Alexandre&rsquo;s brutal
      knock. What could she do? If she did not open the door, the bandit would
      go on knocking, and raise a scandal. She was obliged to open it, but
      things did not take the violent tragical turn which she had feared.
      Surprised at seeing a lady there, Alexandre did not even open his mouth.
      He simply slipped inside, and stationed himself bolt upright against the
      wall. The lady-delegate had raised her eyes and then carried them
      elsewhere, understanding that this young fellow must be some friend,
      probably some relative. And without thought of concealment, she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are twenty francs, I can&rsquo;t do more. Only I promise you that I will
      try to double the amount next month. It will be the rent month, and I&rsquo;ve
      already applied for help on all sides, and people have promised to give me
      the utmost they can. But shall I ever have enough? So many applications
      are made to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her little bag had remained open on her knees, and Alexandre, with his
      glittering eyes, was searching it, weighing in fancy all the treasure of
      the poor that it contained, all the gold and silver and even the copper
      money that distended its sides. Still in silence, he watched Madame
      Angelin as she closed it, slipped its little chain round her wrist, and
      then finally rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, au revoir, till next month then,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I shall certainly
      call on the 5th; and in all probability I shall begin my round with you.
      But it&rsquo;s possible that it may be rather late in the afternoon, for it
      happens to be my poor husband&rsquo;s name-day. And so be brave and work well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine and Cecile had likewise risen, in order to escort her to the door.
      Here again there was an outpouring of gratitude, and the child once more
      kissed the good lady on both cheeks with all his little heart. The
      sisters, so terrified by Alexandre&rsquo;s arrival, at last began to breathe
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact the incident terminated fairly well, for the young man
      showed himself accommodating. When Cecile returned from obtaining change
      for the gold, he contented himself with taking one of the four five-franc
      pieces which she brought up with her. And he did not tarry to torture them
      as was his wont, but immediately went off with the money he had levied,
      whistling the while the air of a hunting-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 5th of the ensuing month, a Saturday, was one of the gloomiest, most
      rainy days of that wretched, mournful winter. Darkness fell rapidly
      already at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and it became almost night. At
      the deserted end of Rue de la Federation there was an expanse of waste
      ground, a building site, for long years enclosed by a fence, which
      dampness had ended by rotting. Some of the boards were missing, and at one
      part there was quite a breach. All through that afternoon, in spite of the
      constantly recurring downpours, a scraggy girl remained stationed near
      that breach, wrapped to her eyes in the ragged remnants of an old shawl,
      doubtless for protection against the cold. She seemed to be waiting for
      some chance meeting, the advent it might be of some charitably disposed
      wayfarer. And her impatience was manifest, for while keeping close to the
      fence like some animal lying in wait, she continually peered through the
      breach, thrusting out her tapering weasel&rsquo;s head and watching yonder, in
      the direction of the Champ de Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours went by, three o&rsquo;clock struck, and then such dark clouds rolled over
      the livid sky, that the girl herself became blurred, obscured, as if she
      were some mere piece of wreckage cast into the darkness. At times she
      raised her head and watched the sky darken, with eyes that glittered as if
      to thank it for throwing so dense a gloom over that deserted corner, that
      spot so fit for an ambuscade. And just as the rain had once more begun to
      fall, a lady could be seen approaching, a lady clad in black, quite black,
      under an open umbrella. While seeking to avoid the puddles in her path,
      she walked on quickly, like one in a hurry, who goes about her business on
      foot in order to save herself the expense of a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      From some precise description which she had obtained, Toinette, the girl,
      appeared to recognize this lady from afar off. She was indeed none other
      than Madame Angelin, coming quickly from the Rue de Lille, on her way to
      the homes of her poor, with the little chain of her little bag encircling
      her wrist. And when the girl espied the gleaming steel of that little
      chain, she no longer had any doubts, but whistled softly. And forthwith
      cries and moans arose from a dim corner of the vacant ground, while she
      herself began to wail and call distressfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished, disturbed by it all, Madame Angelin stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, my girl?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, my brother has fallen yonder and broken his leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, fallen? What has he fallen from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, there&rsquo;s a shed yonder where we sleep, because we haven&rsquo;t any
      home, and he was using an old ladder to try to prevent the rain from
      pouring in on us, and he fell and broke his leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the girl burst into sobs, asking what was to become of them,
      stammering that she had been standing there in despair for the last ten
      minutes, but could see nobody to help them, which was not surprising with
      that terrible rain falling and the cold so bitter. And while she stammered
      all this, the calls for help and the cries of pain became louder in the
      depths of the waste ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Madame Angelin was terribly upset, she nevertheless hesitated, as
      if distrustful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must run to get a doctor, my poor child,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I can do
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but you can, madame; come with me, I pray you. I don&rsquo;t know where
      there&rsquo;s a doctor to be found. Come with me, and we will pick him up, for I
      can&rsquo;t manage it by myself; and at all events we can lay him in the shed,
      so that the rain sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pour down on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the good woman consented, so truthful did the girl&rsquo;s accents
      seem to be. Constant visits to the vilest dens, where crime sprouted from
      the dunghill of poverty, had made Madame Angelin brave. She was obliged to
      close her umbrella when she glided through the breach in the fence in the
      wake of the girl, who, slim and supple like a cat, glided on in front,
      bareheaded, in her ragged shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, madame,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Take care, for there are some
      trenches.... It&rsquo;s over yonder at the end. Can you hear how he&rsquo;s moaning,
      poor brother?... Ah! here we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came swift and overwhelming savagery. The three bandits, Alexandre,
      Richard, and Alfred, who had been crouching low, sprang forward and threw
      themselves upon Madame Angelin with such hungry, wolfish violence that she
      was thrown to the ground. Alfred, however, being a coward, then left her
      to the two others, and hastened with Toinette to the breach in order to
      keep watch. Alexandre, who had a handkerchief rolled up, all ready, thrust
      it into the poor lady&rsquo;s mouth to stifle her cries. Their intention was to
      stun her only and then make off with her little bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the handkerchief must have slipped out, for she suddenly raised a
      shriek, a loud and terrible shriek. And at that moment the others near the
      breach gave the alarm whistle: some people were, doubtless, drawing near.
      It was necessary to finish. Alexandre knotted the handkerchief round the
      unhappy woman&rsquo;s neck, while Richard with his fist forced her shriek back
      into her throat. Red madness fell upon them, they both began to twist and
      tighten the handkerchief, and dragged the poor creature over the muddy
      ground until she stirred no more. Then, as the whistle sounded again, they
      took the bag, left the body there with the handkerchief around the neck,
      and galloped, all four of them, as far as the Grenelle bridge, whence they
      flung the bag into the Seine, after greedily thrusting the coppers, and
      the white silver, and the yellow gold into their pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu read the particulars of the crime in the newspapers, he was
      seized with fright and hastened to the Rue de la Federation. The murdered
      woman had been promptly identified, and the circumstance that the crime
      had been committed on that plot of vacant ground but a hundred yards or so
      from the house where Norine and Cecile lived upset him, filled him with a
      terrible presentiment. And he immediately realized that his fears were
      justified when he had to knock three times at Norine&rsquo;s door before Cecile,
      having recognized his voice, removed the articles with which it had been
      barricaded, and admitted him inside. Norine was in bed, quite ill, and as
      white as her sheets. She began to sob and shuddered repeatedly as she told
      him the story: Madame Angelin&rsquo;s visit the previous month, and the sudden
      arrival of Alexandre, who had seen the bag and had heard the promise of
      further help, at a certain hour on a certain date. Besides, Norine could
      have no doubts, for the handkerchief found round the victim&rsquo;s neck was one
      of hers which Alexandre had stolen: a handkerchief embroidered with the
      initial letters of her Christian name, one of those cheap fancy things
      which are sold by thousands at the big linendrapery establishments. That
      handkerchief, too, was the only clew to the murderers, and it was such a
      very vague one that the police were still vainly seeking the culprits,
      quite lost amid a variety of scents and despairing of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu sat near the bed listening to Norine and feeling icy cold. Good
      God! that poor, unfortunate Madame Angelin! He could picture her in her
      younger days, so gay and bright over yonder at Janville, roaming the woods
      there in the company of her husband, the pair of them losing themselves
      among the deserted paths, and lingering in the discreet shade of the
      pollard willows beside the Yeuse, where their love kisses sounded beneath
      the branches like the twittering of song birds. And he could picture her
      at a later date, already too severely punished for her lack of foresight,
      in despair at remaining childless, and bowed down with grief as by slow
      degrees her husband became blind, and night fell upon the little happiness
      yet left to them. And all at once Mathieu also pictured that wretched
      blind man, on the evening when he vainly awaited the return of his wife,
      in order that she might feed him and put him to bed, old child that he
      was, now motherless, forsaken, forever alone in his dark night, in which
      he could only see the bloody spectre of his murdered helpmate. Ah! to
      think of it, so bright a promise of radiant life, followed by such
      destiny, such death!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did right,&rdquo; muttered Mathieu, as his thoughts turned to Constance, &ldquo;we
      did right to keep that ruffian in ignorance of his father&rsquo;s name. What a
      terrible thing! We must bury the secret as deeply as possible within us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norine shuddered once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! have no fear,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I would die rather than speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Months, years, flowed by; and never did the police discover the murderers
      of the lady with the little bag. For years, too, Norine shuddered every
      time that anybody knocked too roughly at her door. But Alexandre did not
      reappear there. He doubtless feared that corner of the Rue de la
      Federation, and remained as it were submerged in the dim unsoundable
      depths of the ocean of Paris.

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      DURING the ten years which followed, the vigorous sprouting of the
      Froments, suggestive of some healthy vegetation of joy and strength,
      continued in and around the ever and ever richer domain of Chantebled. As
      the sons and the daughters grew up there came fresh marriages, and more
      and more children, all the promised crop, all the promised swarming of a
      race of conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      First it was Gervais who married Caroline Boucher, daughter of a big
      farmer of the region, a fair, fine-featured, gay, strong girl, one of
      those superior women born to rule over a little army of servants. On
      leaving a Parisian boarding-school she had been sensible enough to feel no
      shame of her family&rsquo;s connection with the soil. Indeed she loved the earth
      and had set herself to win from it all the sterling happiness of her life.
      By way of dowry she brought an expanse of meadow-land in the direction of
      Lillebonne, which enlarged the estate by some seventy acres. But she more
      particularly brought her good humor, her health, her courage in rising
      early, in watching over the farmyard, the dairy, the whole home, like an
      energetic active housewife, who was ever bustling about, and always the
      last to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the turn of Claire, whose marriage with Frederic Berthaud, long
      since foreseen, ended by taking place. There were tears of soft emotion,
      for the memory of her whom Berthaud had loved and whom he was to have
      married disturbed several hearts on the wedding day when the family
      skirted the little cemetery of Janville as it returned to the farm from
      the municipal offices. But, after all, did not that love of former days,
      that faithful fellow&rsquo;s long affection, which in time had become
      transferred to the younger sister, constitute as it were another link in
      the ties which bound him to the Froments? He had no fortune, he brought
      with him only his constant faithfulness, and the fraternity which had
      sprung up between himself and Gervais during the many seasons when they
      had ploughed the estate like a span of tireless oxen drawing the same
      plough. His heart was one that could never be doubted, he was the helper
      who had become indispensable, the husband whose advent would mean the best
      of all understandings and absolute certainty of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day of that wedding the government of the farm was finally
      settled. Though Mathieu was barely five-and-fifty he abdicated, and
      transferred his authority to Gervais, that son of the earth as with a
      laugh he often called him, the first of his children born at Chantebled,
      the one who had never left the farm, and who had at all times given him
      the support of his arm and his brain and his heart. And now Frederic in
      turn would think and strive as Gervais&rsquo;s devoted lieutenant, in the great
      common task. Between them henceforth they would continue the father&rsquo;s
      work, and perfect the system of culture, procuring appliances of new
      design from the Beauchene works, now ruled by Denis, and ever drawing from
      the soil the largest crops that it could be induced to yield. Their wives
      had likewise divided their share of authority; Claire surrendered the
      duties of supervision to Caroline, who was stronger and more active than
      herself, and was content to attend to the accounts, the turnover of
      considerable sums of money, all that was paid away and all that was
      received. The two couples seemed to have been expressly and cleverly
      selected to complete one another and to accomplish the greatest sum of
      work without ever the slightest fear of conflict. And, indeed, they lived
      in perfect union, with only one will among them, one purpose which was
      ever more and more skilfully effected&mdash;the continual increase of the
      happiness and wealth of Chantebled under the beneficent sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, if Mathieu had renounced the actual exercise of
      authority, he none the less remained the creator, the oracle who was
      consulted, listened to, and obeyed. He dwelt with Marianne in the old
      shooting-box which had been transformed and enlarged into a very
      comfortable house. Here they lived like the founders of a dynasty who had
      retired in full glory, setting their only delight in beholding around them
      the development and expansion of their race, the birth and growth of their
      children&rsquo;s children. Leaving Claire and Gervais on one side, there were as
      yet only Denis and Ambroise&mdash;the first to wing their flight abroad&mdash;engaged
      in building up their fortunes in Paris. The three girls, Louise,
      Madeleine, and Marguerite, who would soon be old enough to marry, still
      dwelt in the happy home beside their parents, as well as the three
      youngest boys, Gregoire, the free lance, Nicolas, the most stubborn and
      determined of the brood, and Benjamin, who was of a dreamy nature. All
      these finished growing up at the edge of the nest, so to say, with the
      window of life open before them, ready for the day when they likewise
      would take wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With them dwelt Charlotte, Blaise&rsquo;s widow, and her two children, Berthe
      and Guillaume, the three of them occupying an upper floor of the house
      where the mother had installed her studio. She was becoming rich since her
      little share in the factory profits, stipulated by Denis, had been
      increasing year by year; but nevertheless, she continued working for her
      dealer in miniatures. This work brought her pocket-money, she gayly said,
      and would enable her to make her children a present whenever they might
      marry. There was, indeed, already some thought of Berthe marrying; and
      assuredly she would be the first of Mathieu and Marianne&rsquo;s grandchildren
      to enter into the state of matrimony. They smiled softly at the idea of
      becoming great-grandparents before very long perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of four years, Gregoire, first of the younger children,
      flew away. There was a great deal of trouble, quite a little drama in
      connection with the affair, which Mathieu and Marianne had for some time
      been anticipating. Gregoire was anything but reasonable. Short, but
      robust, with a pert face in which glittered the brightest of eyes, he had
      always been the turbulent member of the family, the one who caused the
      most anxiety. His childhood had been spent in playing truant in the woods
      of Janville, and he had afterwards made a mere pretence of studying in
      Paris, returning home full of health and spirits, but unable or unwilling
      to make up his mind with respect to any particular trade or profession.
      Already four-and-twenty, he knew little more than how to shoot and fish,
      and trot about the country on horseback. He was certainly not more stupid
      or less active than another, but he seemed bent on living and amusing
      himself according to his fancy. The worst was that for some months past
      all the gossips of Janville had been relating that he had renewed his
      former boyish friendship with Therese Lepailleur, the miller&rsquo;s daughter,
      and that they were to be met of an evening in shady nooks under the
      pollard-willows by the Yeuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Mathieu, wishing to ascertain if the young coveys of
      partridges were plentiful in the direction of Mareuil, took Gregoire with
      him; and when they found themselves alone among the plantations of the
      plateau, he began to talk to him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not pleased with you, my lad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I really cannot
      understand the idle life which you lead here, while all the rest of us are
      hard at work. I shall wait till October since you have positively promised
      me that you will then come to a decision and choose the calling which you
      most fancy. But what is all this tittle-tattle which I hear about
      appointments which you keep with the daughter of the Lepailleurs? Do you
      wish to cause us serious worry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregoire quietly began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! You are surely not going to scold a son of yours because he
      happens to be on friendly terms with a pretty girl! Why, as you may
      remember, it was I who gave her her first bicycle lesson nearly ten years
      ago. And you will recollect the fine white roses which she helped me to
      secure in the enclosure by the mill for Denis&rsquo; wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregoire still laughed at the memory of that incident, and lived afresh
      through all his old time sweethearting&mdash;the escapades with Therese
      along the river banks, and the banquets of blackberries in undiscoverable
      hiding-places, deep in the woods. And it seemed, too, that the love of
      childhood had revived, and was now bursting into consuming fire, so
      vividly did his cheeks glow, and so hotly did his eyes blaze as he thus
      recalled those distant times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Therese! We had been at daggers drawn for years, and all because one
      evening, on coming back from the fair at Vieux-Bourg, I pushed her into a
      pool of water where she dirtied her frock. It&rsquo;s true that last spring we
      made it up again on finding ourselves face to face in the little wood at
      Monval over yonder. But come, father, do you mean to say that it&rsquo;s a crime
      if we take a little pleasure in speaking to one another when we meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rendered the more anxious by the fire with which Gregoire sought to defend
      the girl, Mathieu spoke out plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crime? No, if you just wish one another good day and good evening. Only
      folks relate that you are to be seen at dusk with your arms round each
      other&rsquo;s waist, and that you go stargazing through the grass alongside the
      Yeuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Gregoire this time without replying laughed yet more loudly, with
      the merry laugh of youth, his father gravely resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my lad, it is not at all to my taste to play the gendarme behind
      my sons. But I won&rsquo;t have you drawing some unpleasant business with the
      Lepailleurs on us all. You know the position, they would be delighted to
      give us trouble. So don&rsquo;t give them occasion for complaining, leave their
      daughter alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I take plenty of care,&rdquo; cried the young man, thus suddenly confessing
      the truth. &ldquo;Poor girl! She has already had her ears boxed because somebody
      told her father that I had been met with her. He answered that rather than
      give her to me he would throw her into the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you see,&rdquo; concluded Mathieu. &ldquo;It is understood, is it not? I shall
      rely on your good behavior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon they went their way, scouring the fields as far as the road to
      Mareuil. Coveys of young partridges, still weak on the wing, started up
      both to the right and to the left. The shooting would be good. Then as the
      father and the son turned homeward, slackening their pace, a long spell of
      silence fell between them. They were both reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish that there should be any misunderstanding between us,&rdquo;
       Mathieu suddenly resumed; &ldquo;you must not imagine that I shall prevent you
      from marrying according to your tastes and that I shall require you to
      take an heiress. Our poor Blaise married a portionless girl. And it was
      the same with Denis; besides which I gave your sister, Claire, in marriage
      to Frederic, who was simply one of our farm hands. So I don&rsquo;t look down on
      Therese. On the contrary, I think her charming. She&rsquo;s one of the prettiest
      girls of the district&mdash;not tall, certainly, but so alert and
      determined, with her little pink face shining under such a wild crop of
      fair hair, that one might think her powdered with all the flour in the
      mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t that so, father?&rdquo; interrupted Gregoire enthusiastically. &ldquo;And
      if you only knew how affectionate and courageous she is! She&rsquo;s worth a man
      any day. It&rsquo;s wrong of them to smack her, for she will never put up with
      it. Whenever she sets her mind on anything she&rsquo;s bound to do it, and it
      isn&rsquo;t I who can prevent her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in some reflections of his own, Mathieu scarcely heard his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t look down on their mill. If it
      were not for Lepailleur&rsquo;s stupid obstinacy he would be drawing a fortune
      from that mill nowadays. Since corn-growing has again been taken up all
      over the district, thanks to our victory, he might have got a good pile of
      crowns together if he had simply changed the old mechanism of his wheel
      which he leaves rotting under the moss. And better still, I should like to
      see a good engine there, and a bit of a light railway line connecting the
      mill with Janville station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this fashion he continued explaining his ideas while Gregoire listened,
      again quite lively and taking things in a jesting way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; the young man ended by saying, &ldquo;as you wish that I should
      have a calling, it&rsquo;s settled. If I marry Therese, I&rsquo;ll be a miller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu protested in surprise: &ldquo;No, no, I was merely talking. And besides,
      you have promised me, my lad, that you will be reasonable. So once again,
      for the sake of the peace and quietness of all of us, leave Therese alone,
      for we can only expect to reap worry with the Lepailleurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation ceased and they returned to the farm. That evening,
      however, the father told the mother of the young man&rsquo;s confession, and
      she, who already entertained various misgivings, felt more anxious than
      ever. Still a month went by without anything serious happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one morning Marianne was astounded at finding Gregoire&rsquo;s bedroom
      empty. As a rule he came to kiss her. Perhaps he had risen early, and had
      gone on some excursion in the environs. But she trembled slightly when she
      remembered how lovingly he had twice caught her in his arms on the
      previous night when they were all retiring to bed. And as she looked
      inquisitively round the room she noticed on the mantelshelf a letter
      addressed to her&mdash;a prettily worded letter in which the young fellow
      begged her to forgive him for causing her grief, and asked her to excuse
      him with his father, for it was necessary that he should leave them for a
      time. Of his reasons for doing so and his purpose, however, no particulars
      were given.
    </p>
    <p>
      This family rending, this bad conduct on the part of the son who had been
      the most spoilt of all, and who, in a fit of sudden folly was the first to
      break the ties which united the household together, was a very painful
      blow for Marianne and Mathieu. They were the more terrified since they
      divined that Gregoire had not gone off alone. They pieced together the
      incidents of the deplorable affair. Charlotte remembered that she had
      heard Gregoire go downstairs again, almost immediately after entering his
      bedroom, and before the servants had even bolted the house-doors for the
      night. He had certainly rushed off to join Therese in some coppice, whence
      they must have hurried away to Vieux-Bourg station which the last train to
      Paris quitted at five-and-twenty minutes past midnight. And it was indeed
      this which had taken place. At noon the Froments already learnt that
      Lepailleur was creating a terrible scandal about the flight of Therese. He
      had immediately gone to the gendarmes to shout the story to them, and
      demand that they should bring the guilty hussy back, chained to her
      accomplice, and both of them with gyves about their wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He on his side had found a letter in his daughter&rsquo;s bedroom, a plucky
      letter in which she plainly said that as she had been struck again the
      previous day, she had had enough of it, and was going off of her own free
      will. Indeed, she added that she was taking Gregoire with her, and was
      quite big and old enough, now that she was two-and-twenty, to know what
      she was about. Lepailleur&rsquo;s fury was largely due to this letter which he
      did not dare to show abroad; besides which, his wife, ever at war with him
      respecting their son Antonin, not only roundly abused Therese, but
      sneeringly declared that it might all have been expected, and that he, the
      father, was the cause of the gad-about&rsquo;s misconduct. After that, they
      engaged in fisticuffs; and for a whole week the district did nothing but
      talk about the flight of one of the Chantebled lads with the girl of the
      mill, to the despair of Mathieu and Marianne, the latter of whom in
      particular grieved over the sorry business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days later, a Sunday, matters became even worse. As the search for
      the runaways remained fruitless Lepailleur, boiling over with rancor, went
      up to the farm, and from the middle of the road&mdash;for he did not
      venture inside&mdash;poured forth a flood of ignoble insults. It so
      happened that Mathieu was absent; and Marianne had great trouble to
      restrain Gervais as well as Frederic, both of whom wished to thrust the
      miller&rsquo;s scurrilous language back into his throat. When Mathieu came home
      in the evening he was extremely vexed to hear of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for this state of things to continue,&rdquo; he said to his
      wife, as they were retiring to rest. &ldquo;It looks as if we were hiding, as if
      we were guilty in the matter. I will go to see that man in the morning.
      There is only one thing, and a very simple one, to be done, those unhappy
      children must be married. For our part we consent, is it not so? And it is
      to that man&rsquo;s advantage to consent also. To-morrow the matter must be
      settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, Monday, at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Mathieu set
      out for the mill. But certain complications, a tragic drama, which he
      could not possibly foresee, awaited him there. For years now a stubborn
      struggle had been going on between Lepailleur and his wife with respect to
      Antonin. While the farmer had grown more and more exasperated with his
      son&rsquo;s idleness and life of low debauchery in Paris, the latter had
      supported her boy with all the obstinacy of an illiterate woman, who was
      possessed of a blind faith in his fine handwriting, and felt convinced
      that if he did not succeed in life it was simply because he was refused
      the money necessary for that purpose. In spite of her sordid avarice in
      some matters, the old woman continued bleeding herself for her son, and
      even robbed the house, promptly thrusting out her claws and setting her
      teeth ready to bite whenever she was caught in the act, and had to defend
      some twenty-franc piece or other, which she had been on the point of
      sending away. And each time the battle began afresh, to such a point
      indeed that it seemed as if the shaky old mill would some day end by
      falling on their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, Antonin, a perfect wreck at thirty-six years of age,
      fell seriously ill. Lepailleur forthwith declared that if the scamp had
      the audacity to come home he would pitch him over the wheel into the
      water. Antonin, however, had no desire to return home; he held the country
      in horror and feared, too, that his father might chain him up like a dog.
      So his mother placed him with some people of Batignolles, paying for his
      board and for the attendance of a doctor of the district. This had been
      going on for three months or so, and every fortnight La Lepailleur went to
      see her son. She had done so the previous Thursday, and on the Sunday
      evening she received a telegram summoning her to Batignolles again. Thus,
      on the morning of the day when Mathieu repaired to the mill, she had once
      more gone to Paris after a frightful quarrel with her husband, who asked
      if their good-for-nothing son ever meant to cease fooling them and
      spending their money, when he had not the courage even to turn a spit of
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in the mill that morning Lepailleur did not cease storming. At the
      slightest provocation he would have hammered his plough to pieces, or have
      rushed, axe in hand, and mad with hatred, on the old wheel by way of
      avenging his misfortunes. When he saw Mathieu come in he believed in some
      act of bravado, and almost choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, neighbor,&rdquo; said the master of Chantebled cordially, &ldquo;let us both
      try to be reasonable. I&rsquo;ve come to return your visit, since you called
      upon me yesterday. Only, bad words never did good work, and the best
      course, since this misfortune has happened, is to repair it as speedily as
      possible. When would you have us marry off those bad children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thunderstruck by the quiet good nature of this frontal attack, Lepailleur
      did not immediately reply. He had shouted over the house roofs that he
      would have no marriage at all, but rather a good lawsuit by way of sending
      all the Froments to prison. Nevertheless, when it came to reflection, a
      son of the big farmer of Chantebled was not to be disdained as a
      son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry them, marry them,&rdquo; he stammered at the first moment. &ldquo;Yes, by
      fastening a big stone to both their necks and throwing them together into
      the river. Ah! the wretches! I&rsquo;ll skin them, I will, her as well as him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, the miller grew calmer and was even showing a
      disposition to discuss matters, when all at once an urchin of Janville
      came running across the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, eh?&rdquo; called the master of the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Monsieur Lepailleur, it&rsquo;s a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, give it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad, well pleased with the copper he received as a gratuity, had
      already gone off, and still the miller, instead of opening the telegram,
      stood examining the address on it with the distrustful air of a man who
      does not often receive such communications. However, he at last had to
      tear it open. It contained but three words: &ldquo;Your son dead&rdquo;; and in that
      brutal brevity, that prompt, hasty bludgeon-blow, one could detect the
      mother&rsquo;s cold rage and eager craving to crush without delay the man, the
      father yonder, whom she accused of having caused her son&rsquo;s death, even as
      she had accused him of being responsible for her daughter&rsquo;s flight. He
      felt this full well, and staggered beneath the shock, stunned by the words
      that appeared on that strip of blue paper, reading them again and again
      till he ended by understanding them. Then his hands began to tremble and
      he burst into oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder and blazes! What again is this? Here&rsquo;s the boy dying now!
      Everything&rsquo;s going to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his heart dilated and tears appeared in his eyes. Unable to remain
      standing, he sank upon a chair and again obstinately read the telegram;
      &ldquo;Your son dead&mdash;Your son dead,&rdquo; as if seeking something else, the
      particulars, indeed, which the message did not contain. Perhaps the boy
      had died before his mother&rsquo;s arrival. Or perhaps she had arrived just
      before he died. Such were his stammered comments. And he repeated a score
      of times that she had taken the train at ten minutes past eleven and must
      have reached Batignolles about half-past twelve. As she had handed in the
      telegram at twenty minutes past one it seemed more likely that she had
      found the lad already dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse it! curse it!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;a cursed telegram, it tells you
      nothing, and it murders you! She might, at all events, have sent somebody.
      I shall have to go there. Ah the whole thing&rsquo;s complete, it&rsquo;s more than a
      man can bear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lepailleur shouted those words in such accents of rageful despair that
      Mathieu, full of compassion, made bold to intervene. The sudden shock of
      the tragedy had staggered him, and he had hitherto waited in silence. But
      now he offered his services and spoke of accompanying the other to Paris.
      He had to retreat, however, for the miller rose to his feet, seized with
      wild exasperation at perceiving him still there in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, you came; and what was it you were saying to me? That we ought
      to marry off those wretched children? Well, you can see that I&rsquo;m in proper
      trim for a wedding! My boy&rsquo;s dead! You&rsquo;ve chosen your day well. Be off
      with you, be off with you, I say, if you don&rsquo;t want me to do something
      dreadful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his fists, quite maddened as he was by the presence of Mathieu
      at that moment when his whole life was wrecked. It was terrible indeed
      that this bourgeois who had made a fortune by turning himself into a
      peasant should be there at the moment when he so suddenly learnt the death
      of Antonin, that son whom he had dreamt of turning into a Monsieur by
      filling his mind with disgust of the soil and sending him to rot of
      idleness and vice in Paris! It enraged him to find that he had erred, that
      the earth whom he had slandered, whom he had taxed with decrepitude and
      barrenness was really a living, youthful, and fruitful spouse to the man
      who knew how to love her! And nought but ruin remained around him, thanks
      to his imbecile resolve to limit his family: a foul life had killed his
      only son, and his only daughter had gone off with a scion of the
      triumphant farm, while he was now utterly alone, weeping and howling in
      his deserted mill, that mill which he had likewise disdained and which was
      crumbling around him with old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Therese may drag herself at my feet; but I
      will never, never give her to your thief of a son! You&rsquo;d like it, wouldn&rsquo;t
      you? so that folks might mock me all over the district, and so that you
      might eat me up as you have eaten up all the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This finish to it all had doubtless appeared to him, confusedly, in a
      sudden threatening vision: Antonin being dead, it was Gregoire who would
      possess the mill, if he should marry Therese. And he would possess the
      moorland also, that enclosure, hitherto left barren with such savage
      delight, and so passionately coveted by the farm. And doubtless he would
      cede it to the farm as soon as he should be the master. The thought that
      Chantebled might yet be increased by the fields which he, Lepailleur, had
      withheld from it brought the miller&rsquo;s delirious rage to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son, I&rsquo;ll send him to the galleys! And you, if you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll
      throw you out! Be off with you, be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, who was very pale, slowly retired before this furious madman. But
      as he went off he calmly said: &ldquo;You are an unhappy man. I forgive you, for
      you are in great grief. Besides, I am quite easy, sensible things always
      end by taking place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, a month went by. Then, one rainy morning in October, Madame
      Lepailleur was found hanging in the mill stable. There were folks at
      Janville who related that Lepailleur had hung her there. The truth was
      that she had given signs of melancholia ever since the death of Antonin.
      Moreover, the life led at the mill was no longer bearable; day by day the
      husband and wife reproached one another for their son&rsquo;s death and their
      daughter&rsquo;s flight, battling ragefully together like two abandoned beasts
      shut up in the same cage. Folks were merely astonished that such a harsh,
      avaricious woman should have been willing to quit this life without taking
      her goods and chattels with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Therese heard of her mother&rsquo;s death she hastened home,
      repentant, and took her place beside her father again, unwilling as she
      was that he should remain alone in his two-fold bereavement. At first it
      proved a terrible time for her in the company of that brutal old man who
      was exasperated by what he termed his bad luck. But she was a girl of
      sterling courage and prompt decision; and thus, after a few weeks, she had
      made her father consent to her marriage with Gregoire, which, as Mathieu
      had said, was the only sensible course. The news gave great relief at the
      farm whither the prodigal son had not yet dared to return. It was believed
      that the young couple, after eloping together, had lived in some out of
      the way district of Paris, and it was even suspected that Ambroise, who
      was liberally minded, had, in a brotherly way, helped them with his purse.
      And if, on the one hand, Lepailleur consented to the marriage in a
      churlish, distrustful manner&mdash;like one who deemed himself robbed, and
      was simply influenced by the egotistical dread of some day finding himself
      quite alone again in his gloomy house&mdash;Mathieu and Marianne, on the
      other side, were delighted with an arrangement which put an end to an
      equivocal situation that had caused them the greatest suffering, grieved
      as they were by the rebellion of one of their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, it came to pass that Gregoire, once married and
      installed at the mill in accordance with his wife&rsquo;s desire, agreed with
      his father-in-law far better than had been anticipated. This resulted in
      particular from a certain discussion during which Lepailleur had wished to
      make Gregoire swear, that, after his death, he would never dispose of the
      moorland enclosure, hitherto kept uncultivated with peasant stubbornness,
      to any of his brothers or sisters of the farm. Gregoire took no oath on
      the subject, but gayly declared that he was not such a fool as to despoil
      his wife of the best part of her inheritance, particularly as he proposed
      to cultivate those moors and, within two or three years&rsquo; time, make them
      the most fertile land in the district. That which belonged to him did not
      belong to others, and people would soon see that he was well able to
      defend the property which had fallen to his lot. Things took a similar
      course with respect to the mill, where Gregoire at first contented himself
      with repairing the old mechanism, for he was unwilling to upset the
      miller&rsquo;s habits all at once, and therefore postponed until some future
      time the installation of an engine, and the laying down of a line of rails
      to Janville station&mdash;all those ideas formerly propounded by Mathieu
      which henceforth fermented in his audacious young mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wise, then, people found themselves in presence of a new Gregoire.
      The madcap had become wise, only retaining of his youthful follies the
      audacity which is needful for successful enterprise. And it must be said
      that he was admirably seconded by the fair and energetic Therese. They
      were both enraptured at now being free to love each other in the romantic
      old mill, garlanded with ivy, pending the time when they would resolutely
      fling it to the ground to install in its place the great white meal stores
      and huge new mill-stones, which, with their conquering ambition, they
      often dreamt of.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years that followed, Mathieu and Marianne witnessed other
      departures. The three daughters, Louise, Madeleine, and Marguerite, in
      turn took their flight from the family nest. All three found husbands in
      the district. Louise, a plump brunette, all gayety and health, with
      abundant hair and large laughing eyes, married notary Mazaud of Janville,
      a quiet, pensive little man, whose occasional silent smiles alone denoted
      the perfect satisfaction which he felt at having found a wife of such
      joyous disposition. Then Madeleine, whose chestnut tresses were tinged
      with gleaming gold, and who was slimmer than her sister, and of a more
      dreamy style of beauty, her character and disposition refined by her
      musical tastes, made a love match which was quite a romance. Herbette, the
      architect, who became her husband, was a handsome, elegant man, already
      celebrated; he owned near Monvel a park-like estate, where he came to rest
      at times from the fatigue of his labors in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Marguerite, the least pretty of the girls&mdash;indeed, she was
      quite plain, but derived a charm from her infinite goodness of heart&mdash;was
      chosen in marriage by Dr. Chambouvet, a big, genial, kindly fellow, who
      had inherited his father&rsquo;s practice at Vieux-Bourg, where he lived in a
      large white house, which had become the resort of the poor. And thus the
      three girls being married, the only ones who remained with Mathieu and
      Marianne in the slowly emptying nest were their two last boys, Nicolas and
      Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, however, as the youngsters flew away and installed
      themselves elsewhere, there came other little ones, a constant swarming
      due to the many family marriages. In eight years, Denis, who reigned at
      the factory in Paris, had been presented by his wife with three children,
      two boys, Lucien and Paul, and a girl, Hortense. Then Leonce, the son of
      Ambroise, who was conquering such a high position in the commercial world,
      now had a brother, Charles, and two little sisters, Pauline and Sophie. At
      the farm, moreover, Gervais was already the father of two boys, Leon and
      Henri, while Claire, his sister, could count three children, a boy,
      Joseph, and two daughters, Lucile and Angele. There was also Gregoire, at
      the mill, with a big boy who had received the name of Robert; and there
      were also the three last married daughters&mdash;Louise, with a girl two
      years old; Madeleine, with a boy six months of age; and Marguerite, who in
      anticipation of a happy event, had decided to call her child Stanislas, if
      it were a boy, and Christine, if it should be a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus upon every side the family oak spread out its branches, its trunk
      forking and multiplying, and boughs sprouting from boughs at each
      successive season. And withal Mathieu was not yet sixty, and Marianne not
      yet fifty-seven. Both still possessed flourishing health, and strength,
      and gayety, and were ever in delight at seeing the family, which had
      sprung from them, thus growing and spreading, invading all the country
      around, even like a forest born from a single tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great and glorious festival of Chantebled at that period was the
      birth of Mathieu and Marianne&rsquo;s first great-grandchild&mdash;a girl,
      called Angeline, daughter of their granddaughter, Berthe. In this little
      girl, all pink and white, the ever-regretted Blaise seemed to live again.
      So closely did she resemble him that Charlotte, his widow, already a
      grandmother in her forty-second year, wept with emotion at the sight of
      her. Madame Desvignes had died six months previously, passing away, even
      as she had lived, gently and discreetly, at the termination of her task,
      which had chiefly consisted in rearing her two daughters on the scanty
      means at her disposal. Still it was she, who, before quitting the scene,
      had found a husband for her granddaughter, Berthe, in the person of
      Philippe Havard, a young engineer who had recently been appointed
      assistant-manager at a State factory near Mareuil. It was at Chantebled,
      however, that Berthe&rsquo;s little Angeline was born; and on the day of the
      churching, the whole family assembled together there once more to glorify
      the great-grandfather and great-grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; said Marianne gayly, as she stood beside the babe&rsquo;s cradle,
      &ldquo;if the young ones fly away there are others born, and so the nest will
      never be empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; repeated Mathieu with emotion, proud as he felt of that
      continual victory over solitude and death. &ldquo;We shall never be left alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet there came another departure which brought them many tears. Nicolas,
      the youngest but one of their boys, who was approaching his twentieth
      birthday, and thus nigh the cross-roads of life, had not yet decided which
      one he would follow. He was a dark, sturdy young man, with an open,
      laughing face. As a child, he had adored tales of travel and far-away
      adventure, and had always evinced great courage and endurance, returning
      home enraptured from interminable rambles, and never uttering complaints,
      however badly his feet might be blistered. And withal he possessed a most
      orderly mind, ever carefully arranging and classifying his little
      belongings in his drawers, and looking down with contempt on the haphazard
      way in which his sisters kept their things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, as he grew up, he became thoughtful, as if he were vainly
      seeking around him some means of realizing his two-fold craving, that of
      discovering some new land and organizing it properly. One of the last-born
      of a numerous family, he no longer found space enough for the amplitude
      and force of his desires. His brothers and sisters had already taken all
      the surrounding lands, and he stifled, threatened also, as it were, with
      famine, and ever sought the broad expanse that he dreamt of, where he
      might grow and reap his bread. No more room, no more food! At first he
      knew not in which direction to turn, but groped and hesitated for some
      months. Nevertheless, his hearty laughter continued to gladden the house;
      he wearied neither his father nor his mother with the care of his destiny,
      for he knew that he was already strong enough to fix it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no corner left for him at the farm where Gervais and Claire took
      up all the room. At the Beauchene works Denis was all sufficient, reigning
      there like a conscientious toiler, and nothing justified a younger brother
      in claiming a share beside him. At the mill, too, Gregoire was as yet
      barely established, and his kingdom was so small that he could not
      possibly cede half of it. Thus an opening was only possible with Ambroise,
      and Nicolas ended by accepting an obliging offer which the latter made to
      take him on trial for a few months, by way of initiating him into the
      higher branches of commerce. Ambroise&rsquo;s fortune was becoming prodigious
      since old uncle Du Hordel had died, leaving him his commission business.
      Year by year the new master increased his trade with all the countries of
      the world. Thanks to his lucky audacity and broad international views, he
      was enriching himself with the spoils of the earth. And though Nicolas
      again began to stifle in Ambroise&rsquo;s huge store-houses, where the riches of
      distant countries, the most varied climes, were collected together, it was
      there that his real vocation came to him; for a voice suddenly arose,
      calling him away yonder to dim, unknown regions, vast stretches of country
      yet sterile, which needed to be populated, and cleared and sowed with the
      crops of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two months Nicolas kept silent respecting the designs which he was now
      maturing. He was extremely discreet, as are all men of great energy, who
      reflect before they act. He must go, that was certain, since neither space
      nor sufficiency of sunlight remained for him in the cradle of his birth;
      but if he went off alone, would that not be going in an imperfect state,
      deficient in the means needed for the heroic task of populating and
      clearing a new land? He knew a girl of Janville, one Lisbeth Moreau, who
      was tall and strong, and whose robust health, seriousness, and activity
      had charmed him. She was nineteen years of age, and, like Nicolas, she
      stifled in the little nook to which destiny had confined her; for she
      craved for the free and open air, yonder, afar off. An orphan, and long
      dependent on an aunt, who was simply a little village haberdasher, she had
      hitherto, from feelings of affection, remained cloistered in a small and
      gloomy shop. But her aunt had lately died, leaving her some ten thousand
      francs, and her dream was to sell the little business, and go away and
      really live at last. One October evening, when Nicolas and Lisbeth told
      one another things that they had never previously told anybody, they came
      to an understanding. They resolutely took each other&rsquo;s hand and plighted
      their troth for life, for the hard battle of creating a new world, a new
      family, somewhere on the earth&rsquo;s broad surface, in those mysterious, far
      away climes of which they knew so little. &lsquo;Twas a delightful betrothal,
      full of courage and faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only then, everything having been settled, did Nicolas speak out,
      announcing his departure to his father and mother. It was an autumn
      evening, still mild, but fraught with winter&rsquo;s first shiver, and the
      twilight was falling. Intense grief wrung the parents&rsquo; hearts as soon as
      they understood their son. This time it was not simply a young one flying
      from the family nest to build his own on some neighboring tree of the
      common forest; it was flight across the seas forever, severance without
      hope of return. They would see their other children again, but this one
      was breathing an eternal farewell. Their consent would be the share of
      cruel sacrifice, that life demands, their supreme gift to life, the tithe
      levied by life on their affection and their blood. To pursue its victory,
      life, the perpetual conqueror, demanded this portion of their flesh, this
      overplus of the numerous family, which was overflowing, spreading,
      peopling the world. And what could they answer, how could they refuse? The
      son who was unprovided for took himself off; nothing could be more logical
      or more sensible. Far beyond the fatherland there were vast continents yet
      uninhabited, and the seed which is scattered by the breezes of heaven
      knows no frontiers. Beyond the race there is mankind with that endless
      spreading of humanity that is leading us to the one fraternal people of
      the accomplished times, when the whole earth shall be but one sole city of
      truth and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, quite apart from the great dream of those seers, the poets,
      Nicolas, like a practical man, whatever his enthusiasm, gayly gave his
      reasons for departing. He did not wish to be a parasite; he was setting
      off to the conquest of another land, where he would grow the bread he
      needed, since his own country had no field left for him. Besides, he took
      his country with him in his blood; she it was that he wished to enlarge
      afar off with unlimited increase of wealth and strength. It was ancient
      Africa, the mysterious, now explored, traversed from end to end, that
      attracted him. In the first instance he intended to repair to Senegal,
      whence he would doubtless push on to the Soudan, to the very heart of the
      virgin lands where he dreamt of a new France, an immense colonial empire,
      which would rejuvenate the old Gallic race by endowing it with its due
      share of the earth. And it was there that he had the ambition of carving
      out a kingdom for himself, and of founding with Lisbeth another dynasty of
      Froments, and a new Chantebled, covering under the hot sun a tract ten
      times as extensive as the old one, and peopled with the people of his own
      children. And he spoke of all this with such joyous courage that Mathieu
      and Marianne ended by smiling amid their tears, despite the rending of
      their poor hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my lad, we cannot keep you back. Go wherever life calls you, wherever
      you may live with more health and joy and strength. All that may spring
      from you yonder will still be health and joy and strength derived from us,
      of which we shall be proud. You are right, one must not weep, your
      departure must be a fete, for the family does not separate, it simply
      extends, invades, and conquers the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, on the day of farewell, after the marriage of Nicolas and
      Lisbeth there was an hour of painful emotion at Chantebled. The family had
      met to share a last meal all together, and when the time came for the
      young and adventurous couple to tear themselves from the maternal soil
      there were those who sobbed although they had vowed to be very brave.
      Nicolas and Lisbeth were going off with little means, but rich in hopes.
      Apart from the ten thousand francs of the wife&rsquo;s dowry they had only been
      willing to take another ten thousand, just enough to provide for the first
      difficulties. Might courage and labor therefore prove sturdy artisans of
      conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Benjamin, the last born of the brothers Froment, was particularly
      upset by this departure. He was a delicate, good-looking child not yet
      twelve years old, whom his parents greatly spoiled, thinking that he was
      weak. And they were quite determined that they would at all events keep
      him with them, so handsome did they find him with his soft limpid eyes and
      beautiful curly hair. He was growing up in a languid way, dreamy, petted,
      idle among his mother&rsquo;s skirts, like the one charming weakling of that
      strong, hardworking family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me kiss you again, my good Nicolas,&rdquo; said he to his departing
      brother. &ldquo;When will you come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, my little Benjamin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s too long. Come back, come back
      some day, so that I may kiss you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; repeated Nicolas, turning pale himself. &ldquo;Never, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had lifted up the lad, whose tears were raining fast; and then for all
      came the supreme grief, the frightful moment of the hatchet-stroke, of the
      separation which was to be eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, little brother! Good-by, good-by, all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mathieu accompanied the future conqueror to the door for the last
      time wishing him victory, Benjamin in wild grief sought a refuge beside
      his mother who was blinded by her tears. And she caught him up with a
      passionate clasp, as if seized with fear that he also might leave her. He
      was the only one now left to them in the family nest.

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT the factory, in her luxurious house on the quay, where she had long
      reigned as sovereign mistress, Constance for twelve years already had been
      waiting for destiny, remaining rigid and stubborn amid the continual
      crumbling of her life and hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those twelve years Beauchene had pursued a downward course, the
      descent of which was fatal. He was right at the bottom now, in the last
      state of degradation. After beginning simply as a roving husband,
      festively inclined, he had ended by living entirely away from his home,
      principally in the company of two women, aunt and niece. He was now but a
      pitiful human rag, fast approaching some shameful death. And large as his
      fortune had been, it had not sufficed him; as he grew older he had
      squandered money yet more and more lavishly, immense sums being swallowed
      up in disreputable adventures, the scandal of which it had been necessary
      to stifle. Thus he at last found himself poor, receiving but a small
      portion of the ever-increasing profits of the works, which were in full
      prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the disaster which brought so much suffering to Constance in her
      incurable pride. Beauchene, since the death of his son, had quite
      abandoned himself to a dissolute life, thinking of nothing but his
      pleasures, and taking no further interest in his establishment. What was
      the use of defending it, since there was no longer an heir to whom it
      might be transmitted, enlarged and enriched? And thus he had surrendered
      it, bit by bit, to Denis, his partner, whom, by degrees, he allowed to
      become the sole master. On arriving at the works, Denis had possessed but
      one of the six shares which represented the totality of the property
      according to the agreement. And Beauchene had even reserved to himself the
      right of repurchasing that share within a certain period. But far from
      being in a position to do so before the appointed date was passed, he had
      been obliged to cede yet another share to the young man, in order to free
      himself of debts which he could not confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forward it became a habit with Beauchene to cede Denis a
      fresh share every two years. A third followed the second, then came the
      turn of the fourth and the fifth, in such wise, indeed, that after a final
      arrangement, he had not even kept a whole share for himself; but simply
      some portion of the sixth. And even that was really fictitious, for Denis
      had only acknowledged it in order to have a pretext for providing him with
      a certain income, which, by the way, he subdivided, handing half of it to
      Constance every month.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, therefore, was ignorant of nothing. She knew that, as a matter of
      fact, the works would belong to that son of the hated Froments, whenever
      he might choose to close the doors on their old master, who, as it
      happened, was never seen now in the workshops. True, there was a clause in
      the covenant which admitted, so long as that covenant should not be
      broken, the possibility of repurchasing all the shares at one and the same
      time. Was it, then, some mad hope of doing this, a fervent belief in a
      miracle, in the possibility of some saviour descending from Heaven, that
      kept Constance thus rigid and stubborn, awaiting destiny? Those twelve
      years of vain waiting&mdash;and increasing decline did not seem to have
      diminished her conviction that in spite of everything she would some day
      triumph. No doubt her tears had gushed forth at Chantebled in presence of
      the victory of Mathieu and Marianne; but she soon recovered her
      self-possession, and lived on in the hope that some unexpected occurrence
      would at last prove that she, the childless woman, was in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not have said precisely what it was she wished; she was simply
      bent on remaining alive until misfortune should fall upon the
      over-numerous family, to exculpate her for what had happened in her own
      home, the loss of her son who was in the grave, and the downfall of her
      husband who was in the gutter&mdash;all the abomination, indeed, which had
      been so largely wrought by herself, but which filled her with agony.
      However much her heart might bleed over her losses, her vanity as an
      honest bourgeoise filled her with rebellious thoughts, for she could not
      admit that she had been in the wrong. And thus she awaited the revenge of
      destiny in that luxurious house, which was far too large now that she
      alone inhabited it. She only occupied the rooms on the first floor, where
      she shut herself up for days together with an old serving woman, the sole
      domestic that she had retained. Gowned in black, as if bent on wearing
      eternal mourning for Maurice, always erect, stiff, and haughtily silent,
      she never complained, although her covert exasperation had greatly
      affected her heart, in such wise that she experienced at times most
      terrible attacks of stifling. These she kept as secret as possible, and
      one day when the old servant ventured to go for Doctor Boutan she
      threatened her with dismissal. She would not even answer the doctor, and
      she refused to take any remedies, certain as she felt that she would last
      as long as the hope which buoyed her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what anguish it was when she suddenly began to stifle, all alone in
      the empty house, without son or husband near her! She called nobody since
      she knew that nobody would come. And the attack over, with what
      unconquerable obstinacy did she rise erect again, repeating that her
      presence sufficed to prevent Denis from being the master, from reigning
      alone in full sovereignty, and that in any case he would not have the
      house and install himself in it like a conqueror, so long as she had not
      sunk to death under the final collapse of the ceilings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this retired life, Constance, haunted as she was by her fixed idea,
      had no other occupation than that of watching the factory, and
      ascertaining what went on there day by day. Morange, whom she had made her
      confidant, gave her information in all simplicity almost every evening,
      when he came to speak to her for a moment after leaving his office. She
      learnt everything from his lips&mdash;the successive sales of the shares
      into which the property had been divided, their gradual acquisition by
      Denis, and the fact that Beauchene and herself were henceforth living on
      the new master&rsquo;s liberality. Moreover, she so organized her system of
      espionage as to make the old accountant tell her unwittingly all that he
      knew of the private life led by Denis, his wife Marthe, and their
      children, Lucien, Paul, and Hortense all, indeed, that was done and said
      in the modest little pavilion where the young people, in spite of their
      increasing fortune, were still residing, evincing no ambitious haste to
      occupy the large house on the quay. They did not even seem to notice what
      scanty accommodation they had in that pavilion, while she alone dwelt in
      the gloomy mansion, which was so spacious that she seemed quite lost in
      it. And she was enraged, too, by their deference, by the tranquil way in
      which they waited for her to be no more; for she had been unable to make
      them quarrel with her, and was obliged to show herself grateful for the
      means they gave her, and to kiss their children, whom she hated, when they
      brought her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, months and years went by, and almost every evening when Morange for
      a moment called on Constance, he found her in the same little silent
      salon, gowned in the same black dress, and stiffened into a posture of
      obstinate expectancy. Though no sign was given of destiny&rsquo;s revenge, of
      the patiently hoped-for fall of misfortune upon others, she never seemed
      to doubt of her ultimate victory. On the contrary, when things fell more
      and more heavily upon her, she drew herself yet more erect, defying fate,
      buoyed up by the conviction that it would at last be forced to prove that
      she was right. Thus, she remained immutable, superior to fatigue, and ever
      relying on a prodigy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each evening, when Morange called during those twelve years, the
      conversation invariably began in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing fresh since yesterday, dear madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend, nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the chief thing is to enjoy good health. One can wait for better
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nobody enjoys good health; still one waits all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now one evening, at the end of the twelve years, as Morange went in to
      see her, he detected that the atmosphere of the little drawing-room was
      changed, quivering as it were with restrained delight amid the eternal
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing fresh since yesterday, dear madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, there&rsquo;s something fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something favorable I hope, then; something pleasant that you have been
      waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that I have been waiting for&mdash;yes! What one knows how to
      wait for always comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in surprise, feeling almost anxious when he saw how
      altered she was, with glittering eyes and quick gestures. What fulfilment
      of her desires, after so many years of immutable mourning, could have
      resuscitated her like that? She smiled, she breathed vigorously, as if she
      were relieved of the enormous weight which had so long crushed and immured
      her. But when he asked the cause of her great happiness she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not tell you yet, my friend. Perhaps I do wrong to rejoice; for
      everything is still very vague and doubtful. Only somebody told me this
      morning certain things, which I must make sure of, and think over. When I
      have done so I shall confide in you, you may rely on it, for I tell you
      everything; besides which, I shall no doubt need your help. So have a
      little patience, some evening you shall come to dinner with me here, and
      we shall have the whole evening before us to chat at our ease. But ah! <i>mon
      Dieu</i>! if it were only true, if it were only the miracle at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More than three weeks elapsed before Morange heard anything further. He
      saw that Constance was very thoughtful and very feverish, but he did not
      even question her, absorbed as he himself was in the solitary, not to say
      automatic, life which he had made for himself. He had lately completed his
      sixty-ninth year; thirty years had gone by since the death of his wife
      Valerie, more than twenty since his daughter Reine had joined her, and he
      still ever lived on in his methodical, punctual manner, amid the downfall
      of his existence. Never had man suffered more than he, passed through
      greater tragedies, experienced keener remorse, and withal he came and went
      in a careful, correct way, ever and ever prolonging his career of
      mediocrity, like one whom many may have forgotten, but whom keenness of
      grief has preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Morange had evidently sustained some internal damage of a
      nature to cause anxiety. He was lapsing into the most singular manias.
      While obstinately retaining possession of the over-large flat which he had
      formerly occupied with his wife and daughter, he now lived there
      absolutely alone; for he had dismissed his servant, and did his own
      marketing, cooking, and cleaning. For ten years nobody but himself had
      been inside his rooms, and the most filthy neglect was suspected there.
      But in vain did the landlord speak of repairs, he was not allowed even to
      cross the threshold. Moreover, although the old accountant, who was now
      white as snow, with a long, streaming beard, remained scrupulously clean
      of person, he wore a most wretched threadbare coat, which he must have
      spent his evenings in repairing. Such, too, was his maniacal, sordid
      avarice that he no longer spent a farthing on himself apart from the money
      which he paid for his bread&mdash;bread of the commonest kind, which he
      purchased every four days and ate when it was stale, in order that he
      might make it last the longer. This greatly puzzled the people who were
      acquainted with him, and never a week went by without the house-porter
      propounding the question: &ldquo;When a gentleman of such quiet habits earns
      eight thousand francs a year at his office and never spends a cent, what
      can he do with his money?&rdquo; Some folks even tried to reckon up the amount
      which Morange must be piling in some corner, and thought that it might
      perhaps run to some hundreds of thousands of francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more serious trouble declared itself. He was twice snatched away from
      certain death. One day, when Denis was returning homewards across the
      Grenelle bridge he perceived Morange leaning far over the parapet,
      watching the flow of the water, and all ready to make a plunge if he had
      not been grasped by his coat-tails. The poor man, on recovering his
      self-possession, began to laugh in his gentle way, and talked of having
      felt giddy. Then, on another occasion, at the works, Victor Moineaud
      pushed him away from some machinery in motion at the very moment when, as
      if hypnotized, he was about to surrender himself to its devouring
      clutches. Then he again smiled, and acknowledged that he had done wrong in
      passing so near to the wheels. After this he was watched, for people came
      to the conclusion that he occasionally lost his head. If Denis retained
      him as chief accountant, this was, firstly, from a feeling of gratitude
      for his long services; but, apart from that matter, the extraordinary
      thing was that Morange had never discharged his duties more ably,
      obstinately tracing every doubtful centime in his books, and displaying
      the greatest accuracy over the longest additions. Always showing a calm
      and restful face, as though no tempest had ever assailed his heart, he
      clung tightly to his mechanical life, like a discreet maniac, who, though
      people might not know it, ought, perhaps, to have been placed under
      restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, it should be mentioned that for some few years already
      there had been quite a big affair in Morange&rsquo;s life. Although he was
      Constance&rsquo;s confidant, although she had made him her creature by the force
      of her despotic will, he had gradually conceived the greatest affection
      for Denis&rsquo;s daughter, Hortense. As this child grew up, he fancied that he
      found in her his own long-mourned daughter, Reine. She had recently
      completed her ninth year, and each time that Morange met her he was thrown
      into a state of emotion and adoration, the more touching since it was all
      a divine illusion on his part, for the two girls in no wise resembled each
      other, the one having been extremely dark, and the other being nearly
      fair. In spite of his terrible avarice, the accountant loaded Hortense
      with dolls and sweetmeats on every possible occasion; and at last his
      affection for the child absorbed him to such a degree that Constance felt
      offended by it. She thereupon gave him to understand that whosoever was
      not entirely on her side was, in reality, against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all appearance, he made his submission; in reality, he only loved the
      child the more for the thwarting of his passion, and he watched for her in
      order to kiss her in secret. In his daily intercourse with Constance, in
      showing apparent fidelity to the former mistress of the works, he now
      simply yielded to fear, like the poor weak being he was, one whom
      Constance had ever bent beneath her stern hand. The pact between them was
      an old one, it dated from that monstrous thing which they alone knew, that
      complicity of which they never spoke, but which bound them so closely
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, with his weak, good nature, seemed from that day to have remained
      annihilated, tamed, cowed like a frightened animal. Since that day, too,
      he had learnt many other things, and now no secret of the house remained
      unknown to him. This was not surprising. He had been living there so many
      years. He had so often walked to and fro with his short, discreet,
      maniacal step, hearing, seeing, and surprising everything! However, this
      madman, who knew the truth and who remained silent&mdash;this madman, left
      free amid the mysterious drama enacted in the Beauchenes&rsquo; home, was
      gradually coming to a rebellious mood, particularly since he was compelled
      to hide himself to kiss his little friend Hortense. His heart growled at
      the thought of it, and he felt ready to explode should his passion be
      interfered with.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, one evening, Constance kept him to dinner. And he suspected
      that the hour of her revelations had come, on seeing how she quivered and
      how erectly she carried her little figure, like a fighter henceforth
      certain of victory. Nevertheless, although the servant left them alone
      after bringing in at one journey the whole of the frugal repast, she did
      not broach the great affair at table. She spoke of the factory and then of
      Denis and his wife Marthe, whom she criticised, and she was even so
      foolish as to declare that Hortense was badly behaved, ugly, and destitute
      of grace. The accountant, like the coward he was, listened to her, never
      daring to protest in spite of the irritation and rebellion of his whole
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;when one and all are put back
      into their proper places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she waited until they returned to the little drawing-room, and the
      doors were shut behind them; and it was only then, near the fire, amid the
      deep silence of the winter evening, that she spoke out on the subject
      which she had at heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I think I have already told you, my friend, I have need of you. You
      must obtain employment at the works for a young man in whom I am
      interested. And if you desire to please me, you will even take him into
      your own office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange, who was seated in front of her on the other side of the
      chimney-piece, gave her a look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not the master,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;apply to the master, he will
      certainly do whatever you ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not wish to be indebted to Denis in any way. Besides, that would
      not suit my plans. You yourself must recommend the young man, and take him
      as an assistant, coaching him and giving him a post under you. Come, you
      surely have the power to choose a clerk. Besides, I insist on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke like a sovereign, and he bowed his back, for he had obeyed
      people all his life; first his wife, then his daughter, and now that
      dethroned old queen who terrified him in spite of the dim feeling of
      rebellion which had been growing within him for some time past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, I might take the young man on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance did not immediately reply. She had turned towards the fire,
      apparently for the purpose of raising a log of wood with the tongs, but in
      reality to give herself time for further reflection. What good would it do
      to tell him everything at once? She would some day be forced to tell it
      him, if she wished to have him entirely on her side; but there was no
      hurry, and she fancied that it would be skilful policy if at present she
      merely prepared the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a young man whose position has touched me, on account of certain
      recollections,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Perhaps you remember a girl who worked here&mdash;oh!
      a very long time ago, some thirty years at the least&mdash;a certain
      Norine Moineaud, one of old Moineaud&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange had hastily raised his head, and as sudden light flashed on his
      memory he looked at Constance with dilated eyes. Before he could even
      weigh his words he let everything escape him in a cry of surprise:
      &ldquo;Alexandre-Honore, Norine&rsquo;s son, the child of Rougemont!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite thunderstruck by those words, Constance dropped the tongs she was
      holding, and gazed into the old man&rsquo;s eyes, diving to the very depths of
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you know, then!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is it you know? You must tell me;
      hide nothing. Speak! I insist on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he knew? Why, he knew everything. He spoke slowly and at length, as
      from the depths of a dream. He had witnessed everything, learnt everything&mdash;Norine&rsquo;s
      trouble, the money given by Beauchene to provide for her at Madame
      Bourdieu&rsquo;s, the child carried to the Foundling Hospital and then put out
      to nurse at Rougemont, whence he had fled after stealing three hundred
      francs. And the old accountant was even aware that the young scamp, after
      stranding on the pavement of Paris, had led the vilest of lives there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who told you all that? How do you know all that?&rdquo; cried Constance,
      who felt full of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his arm with a vague, sweeping gesture, as if to take in all the
      surrounding atmosphere, the whole house. He knew those things because they
      were things pertaining to the place, which people had told him of, or
      which he had guessed. He could no longer remember exactly how they had
      reached him. But he knew them well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when one has been in a place for more than
      thirty years, things end by coming to one naturally. I know everything,
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance started and deep silence fell. He, with his eyes fixed on the
      embers, had sunk back into the dolorous past. She reflected that it was,
      after all, preferable that the position should be perfectly plain. Since
      he was acquainted with everything, it was only needful that she, with all
      determination and bravery, should utilize him as her docile instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandre-Honore, the child of Rougemont,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes! that is the
      young man whom I have at last found again. But are you also aware of the
      steps which I took twelve years ago, when I despaired of finding him, and
      actually thought him dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange nodded affirmatively, and she again went on speaking, relating
      that she had long since renounced her old plans, when all at once destiny
      had revealed itself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine a flash of lightning!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It was on the morning of
      the day when you found me so moved! My sister-in-law, Seraphine, who does
      not call on me four times a year, came here, to my great surprise, at ten
      o&rsquo;clock. She has become very strange, as you are aware, and I did not at
      first pay any attention to the story which she began to relate to me&mdash;the
      story of a young man whom she had become acquainted with through some lady&mdash;an
      unfortunate young man who had been spoilt by bad company, and whom one
      might save by a little help. Then what a blow it was, my friend, when she
      all at once spoke out plainly, and told me of the discovery which she had
      made by chance. I tell you, it is destiny awaking and striking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story was indeed curious. Prematurely aged though she was, Seraphine,
      amid her growing insanity, continued to lead a wild, rackety life, and the
      strangest stories were related of her. A singular caprice of hers, given
      her own viciousness, was to join, as a lady patroness, a society whose
      purpose was to succor and moralize young offenders on their release from
      prison. And it was in this wise that she had become acquainted with
      Alexandre-Honore, now a big fellow of two-and-thirty, who had just
      completed a term of six years&rsquo; imprisonment. He had ended by telling her
      his true story, speaking of Rougemont, naming Norine his mother, and
      relating the fruitless efforts that he had made in former years to
      discover his father, who was some immensely wealthy man. In the midst of
      it, Seraphine suddenly understood everything, and in particular why it was
      that his face had seemed so familiar to her. His striking resemblance to
      Beauchene sufficed to throw a vivid light upon the question of his
      parentage. For fear of worry, she herself told him nothing, but as she
      remembered how passionately Constance had at one time striven to find him,
      she went to her and acquainted her with her discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows nothing as yet,&rdquo; Constance explained to Morange. &ldquo;My
      sister-in-law will simply send him here as if to a lady friend who will
      find him a good situation. It appears that he now asks nothing better than
      to work. If he has misconducted himself, the unhappy fellow, there have
      been many excuses for it! And, besides, I will answer for him as soon as
      he is in my hands; he will then only do as I tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that Constance knew respecting Alexandre&rsquo;s recent years was a story
      which he had concocted and retailed to Seraphine&mdash;a story to the
      effect that he owed his long term of imprisonment to a woman, the real
      culprit, who had been his mistress and whom he had refused to denounce. Of
      course that imprisonment, whatever its cause, only accounted for six out
      of the twelve years which had elapsed since his disappearance, and the six
      others, of which he said nothing, might conceal many an act of ignominy
      and crime. On the other hand, imprisonment at least seemed to have had a
      restful effect on him; he had emerged from his long confinement, calmer
      and keener-witted, with the intention of spoiling his life no longer. And
      cleansed, clad, and schooled by Seraphine, he had almost become a
      presentable young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morange at last looked up from the glowing embers, at which he had been
      staring so fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want to do with him?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Does he write a
      decent hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his handwriting is good. No doubt, however, he knows very little. It
      is for that reason that I wish to intrust him to you. You will polish him
      up for me and make him conversant with everything. My desire is that in a
      year or two he should know everything about the factory, like a master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that last word which enlightened him, the accountant&rsquo;s good sense
      suddenly awoke. Amid the manias which were wrecking his mind, he had
      remained a man of figures with a passion for arithmetical accuracy, and he
      protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, since you wish me to assist you, pray tell me everything;
      tell me in what work we can employ this young man here. Really now, you
      surely cannot hope through him to regain possession of the factory,
      re-purchase the shares, and become sole owner of the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the greatest logic and clearness, he showed how foolish such a
      dream would be, enumerating figures and fully setting forth how large a
      sum of money would be needed to indemnify Denis, who was installed in the
      place like a conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, dear madame, I don&rsquo;t understand why you should take that young
      man rather than another. He has no legal rights, as you must be aware. He
      could never be anything but a stranger here, and I should prefer an
      intelligent, honest man, acquainted with our line of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance had set to work poking the fire logs with the tongs. When she at
      last looked up she thrust her face towards the other&rsquo;s, and said in a low
      voice, but violently: &ldquo;Alexandre is my husband&rsquo;s son, he is the heir. He
      is not the stranger. The stranger is that Denis, that son of the Froments,
      who has robbed us of our property! You rend my heart; you make it bleed,
      my friend, by forcing me to tell you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer she thus gave was the answer of a conservative bourgeoise, who
      held that it would be more just if the inheritance should go to an
      illegitimate scion of the house rather than to a stranger. Doubtless the
      woman, the wife, the mother within her, bled even as she herself
      acknowledged, but she sacrificed everything to her rancor; she would drive
      the stranger away even if in doing so her own flesh should be lacerated.
      Then, too, it vaguely seemed to her that her husband&rsquo;s son must be in some
      degree her own, since his father was likewise the father of the son to
      whom she had given birth, and who was dead. Besides, she would make that
      young fellow her son; she would direct him, she would compel him to be
      hers, to work through her and for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to know how I shall employ him in the place,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I
      myself don&rsquo;t know. It is evident that I shall not easily find the hundreds
      of thousands of francs which may be required. Your figures are accurate,
      and it is possible that we may never have the money to buy back the
      property. But, all the same, why not fight, why not try? And, besides&mdash;I
      will admit it&mdash;suppose we are vanquished, well then, so much the
      worse for the other. For I assure you that if this young man will only
      listen to me, he will then become the agent of destruction, the avenger
      and punisher, implanted in the factory to wreck it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture which summoned ruin athwart the walls, she finished
      expressing her abominable hopes. Among her vague plans, reared upon hate,
      was that of employing the wretched Alexandre as a destructive weapon,
      whose ravages would bring her some relief. Should she lose all other
      battles, that would assuredly be the final one. And she had attained to
      this pitch of madness through the boundless despair in which the loss of
      her only son had plunged her, withered, consumed by a love which she could
      not content, then demented, perverted to the point of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morange shuddered when, with her stubborn fierceness, she concluded: &ldquo;For
      twelve years past I have been waiting for a stroke of destiny, and here it
      is! I would rather perish than not draw from it the last chance of good
      fortune which it brings me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This meant that Denis&rsquo;s ruin was decided on, and would be effected if
      destiny were willing. And the old accountant could picture the disaster:
      innocent children struck down in the person of their father, a great and
      most unjust catastrophe, which made his kindly heart rise in rebellion.
      Would he allow that fresh crime to be committed without shouting aloud all
      that he knew? Doubtless the memory of the other crime, the first one, the
      monstrous buried crime about which they both kept silence, returned at
      that horrible moment and shone out disturbingly in his eyes, for she
      herself shuddered as if she could see it there, while with the view of
      mastering him she gazed at him fixedly. For a moment, as they peered into
      one another&rsquo;s eyes, they lived once more beside the murderous trap, and
      shivered in the cold gust which rose from the abyss. And this time again
      Morange, like a poor weak man overpowered by a woman&rsquo;s will, was
      vanquished, and did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is agreed, my friend,&rdquo; she softly resumed. &ldquo;I rely on you to take
      Alexandre, in the first place, as a clerk. You can see him here one
      evening at five o&rsquo;clock, after dusk, for I do not wish him to know at
      first what interest I take in him. Shall we say the day after to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the evening of the day after to-morrow, if it pleases you, dear
      madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Morange displayed so much agitation that the wife of the
      door-porter of the house where he resided, a woman who was ever watching
      him, imparted her fears to her husband. The old gentleman was certainly
      going to have an attack, for he had forgotten to put on his slippers when
      he came downstairs to fetch some water in the morning; and, besides, he
      went on talking to himself, and looked dreadfully upset. The most
      extraordinary incident of the day, however, was that after lunch Morange
      quite forgot himself, and was an hour late in returning to his office, a
      lack of punctuality which had no precedent, which, in the memory of
      everybody at the works, had never occurred before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Morange had been carried away as by a storm, and,
      walking straight before him, had once more found himself on the Grenelle
      bridge, where Denis had one day saved him from the fascination of the
      water. And some force, some impulse had carried him again to the very same
      spot, and made him lean over the same parapet, gazing, in the same way as
      previously, at the flowing river. Ever since the previous evening he had
      been repeating the same words, words which he stammered in an undertone,
      and which haunted and tortured him. &ldquo;Would he allow that fresh crime to be
      committed without shouting aloud what he knew?&rdquo; No doubt it was those
      words, of which he could not rid himself, that had made him forget to put
      on his slippers in the morning, and that had just now again dazed him to
      the point of preventing him from returning to the factory, as if he no
      longer recognized the entrance as he passed it. And if he were at present
      leaning over that water, had he not been impelled thither by an
      unconscious desire to have done with all his troubles, an instinctive hope
      of drowning the torment into which he was thrown by those stubbornly
      recurring words? Down below, at the bottom of the river, those words would
      at last cease; he would no longer repeat them; he would no longer hear
      them urging him to an act of energy for which he could not find sufficient
      strength. And the call of the water was very gentle, and it would be so
      pleasant to have to struggle no longer, to yield to destiny, like a poor
      soft-hearted weakling who has lived too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morange leant forward more and more, and in fancy could already feel the
      sonorous river seizing him, when a gay young voice in the rear recalled
      him to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at, Monsieur Morange? Are there any big fishes
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Hortense, looking extremely pretty, and tall already for her ten
      years, whom a maid was conducting on a visit to some little friends at
      Auteuil. And when the distracted accountant turned round, he remained for
      a moment with trembling hands, and eyes moist with tears, at the sight of
      that apparition, that dear angel, who had recalled him from so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it you, my pet!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No, no, there are no big fishes.
      I think that they hide at the bottom because the water is so cold in
      winter. Are you going on a visit? You look quite beautiful in that
      fur-trimmed cloak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl began to laugh, well pleased at being flattered and loved,
      for her old friend&rsquo;s voice quivered with adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am very happy; there are to be some private theatricals where
      I&rsquo;m going. Oh! it is amusing to feel happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke those words like his own Reine might formerly have spoken them,
      and he could have gone down on his knees to kiss her little hands like an
      idol&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is necessary that you should always be happy,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You
      look so beautiful, I must really kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you may, Monsieur Morange, I&rsquo;m quite willing. Ah! you know the doll
      you gave me; her name&rsquo;s Margot, and you have no idea how good she is. Come
      to see her some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had kissed her; and with glowing heart, ready for martyrdom, he watched
      her as she went off in the pale light of winter. What he had thought of
      would be too cowardly: besides, that child must be happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly quitted the bridge, while within him the haunting words rang out
      with decisive distinctness, demanding a reply: &ldquo;Would he allow that fresh
      crime to be committed without shouting aloud what he knew?&rdquo; No, no! It was
      impossible: he would speak, he would act. Nevertheless, his mind remained
      clouded, befogged. How could he speak, how could he act?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to crown his extravagant conduct, utterly breaking away from the
      habits of forty years, he no sooner returned to the office than, instead
      of immediately plunging into his everlasting additions, he began to write
      a long letter. This letter, which was addressed to Mathieu, recounted the
      whole affair&mdash;Alexandre&rsquo;s resurrection, Constance&rsquo;s plans, and the
      service which he himself had promised to render her. These things were set
      down simply as his impulse dictated, like a kind of confession by which he
      relieved his feelings. He had not yet come to any positive decision as to
      how he should play the part of a justiciar, which seemed so heavy to his
      shoulders. His one purpose was to warn Mathieu in order that there might
      be two of them to decide and act. And he simply finished by asking the
      other to come to see him on the following evening, though not before six
      o&rsquo;clock, as he desired to see Alexandre and learn how the interview passed
      off, and what Constance might require of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing night, the ensuing day, must have been full of abominable
      torment for Morange. The doorkeeper&rsquo;s wife recounted, later on, that the
      fourth-floor tenant had heard the old gentleman walking about overhead all
      through the night. Doors were slammed, and furniture was dragged about as
      if for a removal. It was even thought that one could detect cries, sobs,
      and the monologues of a madman addressing phantoms, some mysterious
      rendering of worship to the dead who haunted him. And at the works during
      the day which followed Morange gave alarming signs of distress, of the
      final sinking of his mind into a flood of gloom. Ever darting troubled
      glances around him, he was tortured by internal combats, which, without
      the slightest motive, made him descend the stairs a dozen times, linger
      before the machinery in motion, and then return to his additions up above,
      with the bewildered, distracted air of one who could not find what he
      sought so painfully. When the darkness fell, about four o&rsquo;clock on that
      gloomy winter day, the two clerks whom he had with him in his office
      noticed that he altogether ceased working. From that moment, indeed, he
      waited with his eyes fixed upon the clock. And when five o&rsquo;clock struck he
      once more made sure that a certain total was correct, then rose and went
      out, leaving the ledger open, as if he meant to return to check the next
      addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed the gallery which led to the passage connecting the workshops
      with the private house. The whole factory was at that hour lighted up,
      electric lamps cast the brightness of daylight over it, while the stir of
      work ascended and the walls shook amid the rumbling of machinery. And all
      at once, before reaching the passage, Morange perceived the lift, the
      terrible cavity, the abyss of murder in which Blaise had met his death
      fourteen years previously. Subsequent to that catastrophe, and in order to
      prevent the like of it from ever occurring again, the trap had been
      surrounded by a balustrade with a gate, in such wise that a fall became
      impossible unless one should open the gate expressly to take a plunge. At
      that moment the trap was lowered and the gate was closed, and Morange,
      yielding to some superior force, bent over the cavity, shuddering. The
      whole scene of long ago rose up before him; he was again in the depths of
      that frightful void; he could see the crushed corpse; and he could feel
      the gust of terror chilling him in the presence of murder, accepted and
      concealed. Since he suffered so dreadfully, since he could no longer
      sleep, since he had promised his dear dead ones that he would join them,
      why should he not make an end of himself? Two days previously, while
      leaning over the parapet of the Grenelle bridge, a desire to do so had
      taken possession of him. He merely had to lose his equilibrium and he
      would be liberated, laid to rest in the peaceful earth between his wife
      and his daughter. And, all at once, as if the abyss itself suggested to
      him the frightful solution for which he had been vainly groping, in his
      growing madness, for two days past, he thought that he could hear a voice
      calling him from below, the voice of Blaise, which cried: &ldquo;Come with the
      other one! Come with the other one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started violently and drew himself erect; decision had fallen on him in
      a lightning flash. Insane as he was, that appeared to him to be the one
      sole logical, mathematical, sensible solution, which would settle
      everything. It seemed to him so simple, too, that he was astonished that
      he had sought it so long. And from that moment this poor soft-hearted
      weakling, whose wretched brain was unhinged, gave proof of iron will and
      sovereign heroism, assisted by the clearest reasoning, the most subtle
      craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place he prepared everything, set the catch to prevent the
      trap from being sent up again in his absence, and also assured himself
      that the balustrade door opened and closed easily. He came and went with a
      light, aerial step, as if carried off his feet, with his eyes ever on the
      alert, anxious as he was to be neither seen nor heard. At last he
      extinguished the three electric lamps and plunged the gallery into
      darkness. From below, through the gaping cavity the stir of the working
      factory, the rumbling of the machinery ever ascended. And it was only
      then, everything being ready, that Morange turned into the passage to
      betake himself to the little drawing room of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was there waiting for him with Alexandre. She had given
      instructions for the latter to call half-an-hour earlier, for she wished
      to confess him while as yet telling him nothing of the real position which
      she meant him to take in the house. She was not disposed to place herself
      all at once at his mercy, and had therefore simply expressed her
      willingness to give him employment in accordance with the recommendation
      of her relative, the Baroness de Lowicz. Nevertheless, she studied him
      with restrained ardor, and was well pleased to find that he was strong,
      sturdy, and resolute, with a hard face lighted by terrible eyes, which
      promised her an avenger. She would finish polishing him up, and then he
      would suit her perfectly. For his part, without plainly understanding the
      truth, he scented something, divined that his fortune was at hand, and was
      quite ready to wait awhile for the certain feast, like a young wolf who
      consents to be domesticated in order that he may, later on, devour the
      whole flock at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Morange went in only one thing struck him, Alexandre&rsquo;s resemblance to
      Beauchene, that extraordinary resemblance which had already upset
      Constance, and which now sent an icy chill through the old accountant as
      if in purposing to carry out his idea he had condemned his old master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting for you, my friend; you are late, you who are so punctual
      as a rule,&rdquo; said Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there was a little work which I wished to finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had merely been jesting, she felt so happy. And she immediately
      settled everything: &ldquo;Well, here is the gentleman whom I spoke about,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;You will begin by taking him with you and making him acquainted
      with the business, even if in the first instance you can merely send him
      about on commissions for you. It is understood, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, dear madame, I will take him with me; you may rely on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she gave Alexandre his dismissal, saying that he might come on
      the morrow, Morange offered to show him out by way of his office and the
      workshops, which were still open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that way he will form an acquaintance with the works, and can come
      straight to me to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance laughed again, so fully did the accountant&rsquo;s obligingness
      reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good idea, my friend,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank you. And au revoir,
      monsieur; we will take charge of your future if you behave sensibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, however, she was thunderstruck by an extravagant and
      seemingly senseless incident. Morange, having shown Alexandre out of the
      little salon, in advance of himself, turned round towards her with the
      sudden grimace of a madman, revealing his insanity by the distortion of
      his countenance. And in a low, familiar, sneering voice, he stammered in
      her face: &ldquo;Ha! ha! Blaise at the bottom of the hole! He speaks, he has
      spoken to me! Ha! ha! the somersault! you would have the somersault! And
      you shall have it again, the somersault, the somersault!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he disappeared, following Alexandre.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had listened to him agape with wonder. It was all so unforeseen, so
      idiotic, that at first she did not understand it. But afterwards what a
      flash of light came to her! That which Morange had referred to was the
      murder yonder&mdash;the thing to which they had never referred, the
      monstrous thing which they had kept buried for fourteen years past, which
      their glances only had confessed, but which, all of a sudden, he had cast
      in her teeth with the grimace of a madman. What was the meaning of the
      poor fool&rsquo;s diabolical rebellion, the dim threat which she had felt
      passing like a gust from an abyss? She turned frightfully pale, she
      intuitively foresaw some frightful revenge of destiny, that destiny which,
      only a moment previously, she had believed to be her minion. Yes, it was
      surely that. And she felt herself carried fourteen years backward, and she
      remained standing, quivering, icy cold, listening to the sounds which
      arose from the works, waiting for the awful thud of the fall, even as on
      the distant day when she had listened and waited for the other to be
      crushed and killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Morange, with his discreet, short step, was leading Alexandre
      away, and speaking to him in a quiet, good-natured voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask your pardon for going first, but I have to show you the way.
      Oh! this is a very intricate place, with stairs and passages whose turns
      and twists never end. The passage now turns to the left, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on reaching the gallery where the darkness was complete, he affected
      anger in the most natural manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, that is just their way. They haven&rsquo;t yet lighted up this part.
      The switch is at the other end. Fortunately I know where to step, for I
      have been going backwards and forwards here for the last forty years. Mind
      follow me carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, at each successive step, he warned the other what he ought to
      do, guiding him along in his obliging way without the faintest tremor in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let go of me, turn to the left.&mdash;Now we merely have to go
      straight ahead.&mdash;Only, wait a moment, a barrier intersects the
      gallery, and there is a gate.&mdash;There we are! I&rsquo;m opening the gate,
      you hear?&mdash;Follow me, I&rsquo;ll go first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morange quietly stepped into the void, amid the darkness. And, without a
      cry, he fell. Alexandre who was close in the rear, almost touching him so
      as not to lose him, certainly detected the void and the gust which
      followed the fall, as with sudden horror the flooring failed beneath them;
      but force of motion carried him on, he stepped forward in his turn, howled
      and likewise fell, head over heels. Both were smashed below, both killed
      at once. True, Morange still breathed for a few seconds. Alexandre, for
      his part, lay with his skull broken to pieces and his brains scattered on
      the very spot where Blaise had been picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrible was the stupefaction when those bodies were found there. Nobody
      could explain the catastrophe. Morange carried off his secret, the reason
      for that savage act of justice which he had accomplished according to the
      chance suggestions of his dementia. Perhaps he had wished to punish
      Constance, perhaps he had desired to repair the old wrong: Denis long
      since stricken in the person of his brother, and now saved for the sake of
      his daughter Hortense, who would live happily with Margot, the pretty doll
      who was so good. By suppressing the criminal instrument the old accountant
      had indeed averted the possibility of a fresh crime. Swayed by his fixed
      idea, however, he had doubtless never reasoned that cataclysmic deed of
      justice, which was above reason, and which passed by with the impassive
      savagery of a death-dealing hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the works there was but one opinion, Morange had assuredly been mad;
      and he alone could have caused the accident, particularly as it was
      impossible to account, otherwise than by an act of madness, for the
      extinguishing of the lights, the opening of the balustrade-door, and the
      plunge into the cavity which he knew to be there, and into which had
      followed him the unfortunate young man his companion. Moreover, the
      accountant&rsquo;s madness was no longer doubted by anybody a few days later,
      when the doorkeeper of his house related his final eccentricities, and a
      commissary of police went to search his rooms. He had been mad, mad enough
      to be placed in confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, nobody had ever seen a flat in such an extraordinary condition,
      the kitchen a perfect stable, the drawing-room in a state of utter
      abandonment with its Louis XIV. furniture gray with dust, and the
      dining-room all topsy-turvy, the old oak tables and chairs being piled up
      against the window as if to shut out every ray of light, though nobody
      could tell why. The only properly kept room was that in which Reine had
      formerly slept, which was as clean as a sanctuary, with its pitch-pine
      furniture as bright as if it had been polished every day. But the
      apartment in which Morange&rsquo;s madness became unmistakably manifest was his
      own bedchamber, which he had turned into a museum of souvenirs, covering
      its walls with photographs of his wife and daughter. Above a table there,
      the wall facing the window quite disappeared from view, for a sort of
      little chapel had been set up, decked with a multitude of portraits. In
      the centre were photographs of Valerie and Reine, both of them at twenty
      years of age, so that they looked like twin sisters; while symmetrically
      disposed all around was an extraordinary number of other portraits, again
      showing Valerie and Reine, now as children, now as girls, and now as
      women, in every sort of position, too, and every kind of toilet. And below
      them on the table, like an offering on an altar, was found more than one
      hundred thousand francs, in gold, and silver, and even copper; indeed, the
      whole fortune which Morange had been saving up for several years by eating
      only dry bread, like a pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, then, one knew what he had done with his savings; he had given
      them to his dead wife and daughter, who had remained his will, passion,
      and ambition. Haunted by remorse at having killed them while dreaming of
      making them rich, he reserved for them that money which they had so keenly
      desired, and which they would have spent with so much ardor. It was still
      and ever for them that he earned it, and he took it to them, lavished it
      upon them, never devoting even a tithe of it to any egotistical pleasure,
      absorbed as he was in his vision-fraught worship and eager to pacify and
      cheer their spirits. And the whole neighborhood gossiped endlessly about
      the old mad gentleman who had let himself die of wretchedness by the side
      of a perfect treasure, piled coin by coin upon a table, and for twenty
      years past tendered to the portraits of his wife and daughter, even as
      flowers might have been offered to their memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six o&rsquo;clock, when Mathieu reached the works, he found the place
      terrified by the catastrophe. Ever since the morning he had been rendered
      anxious by Morange&rsquo;s letter, which had greatly surprised and worried him
      with that extraordinary story of Alexandre turning up once more, being
      welcomed by Constance, and introduced by her into the establishment. Plain
      as was the greater part of the letter, it contained some singularly
      incoherent passages, and darted from one point to another with
      incomprehensible suddenness. Mathieu had read it three times, indulging on
      each occasion in fresh hypotheses of a gloomier and gloomier nature; for
      the more he reflected, the more did the affair seem to him to be fraught
      with menace. Then, on reaching the rendezvous appointed by Morange, he
      found himself in presence of those bleeding bodies which Victor Moineaud
      had just picked up and laid out side by side! Silent, chilled to his
      bones, Mathieu listened to his son, Denis, who had hastened up to tell him
      of the unexplainable misfortune, the two men falling one atop of the
      other, first the old mad accountant, and then the young fellow whom nobody
      knew and who seemed to have dropped from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, for his part, had immediately recognized Alexandre, and if, pale
      and terrified, he kept silent on the subject, it was because he desired to
      take nobody, not even his son, into his confidence, given the fresh
      suppositions, the frightful suppositions, which now arose in his mind from
      out of all the darkness. He listened with growing anxiety to the
      enumeration of the few points which were certain: the extinguishing of the
      electric lights in the gallery and the opening of the balustrade door,
      which was always kept closed and could only have been opened by some
      habitue, since, to turn the handle, one had to press a secret spring which
      kept it from moving. And, all at once, as Victor Moineaud pointed out that
      the old man had certainly been the first to fall, since one of the young
      man&rsquo;s legs had been stretched across his stomach, Mathieu was carried
      fourteen years backward. He remembered old Moineaud picking up Blaise on
      the very spot where Victor, the son, had just picked up Morange and
      Alexandre. Blaise! At the thought of his dead boy fresh light came to
      Mathieu, a frightful suspicion blazed up amid the terrible obscurity in
      which he had been groping and doubting. And, thereupon, leaving Denis to
      settle everything down below, he decided to see Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up above, however, when Mathieu was on the point of turning into the
      communicating passage, he paused once more, this time near the lift. It
      was there, fourteen years previously, that Morange, finding the trap open,
      had gone down to warn and chide the workmen, while Constance, according to
      her own account, had quietly returned into the house, at the very moment
      when Blaise, coming from the other end of the dim gallery, plunged into
      the gulf. Everybody had eventually accepted that narrative as being
      accurate, but Mathieu now felt that it was mendacious. He could recall
      various glances, various words, various spells of silence; and sudden
      certainty came upon him, a certainty based on all the petty things which
      he had not then understood, but which now assumed the most frightful
      significance. Yes, it was certain, even though round it there hovered the
      monstrous vagueness of silent crimes, cowardly crimes, over which a shadow
      of horrible mystery always lurks. Moreover, it explained the sequel, those
      two bodies lying below, as far, that is, as logical reasoning can explain
      a madman&rsquo;s action with all its gaps and mysteriousness. Nevertheless,
      Mathieu still strove to doubt; before anything else he wished to see
      Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Showing a waxy pallor, she had remained erect, motionless, in the middle
      of her little drawing-room. The waiting of fourteen years previously had
      begun once more, lasting on and on, and filling her with such anxiety that
      she held her breath the better to listen. Nothing, no stir, no sound of
      footsteps, had yet ascended from the works. What could be happening then?
      Was the hateful thing, the dreaded thing, merely a nightmare after all?
      Yet Morange had really sneered in her face, she had fully understood him.
      Had not a howl, the thud of a fall, just reached her ears? And now, had
      not the rumbling of the machinery ceased? It was death, the factory
      silent, chilled and lost for her. All at once her heart ceased beating as
      she detected a sound of footsteps drawing nearer and nearer with increased
      rapidity. The door opened, and it was Mathieu who came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled, livid, as at the sight of a ghost. He, O God! Why he? How
      was it he was there? Of all the messengers of misfortune he was the one
      whom she had least expected. Had the dead son risen before her she would
      not have shuddered more dreadfully than she did at this apparition of the
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. He simply said: &ldquo;They made the plunge, they are both
      dead&mdash;like Blaise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, though she still said nothing, she looked at him. For a moment their
      eyes met. And in her glance he read everything: the murder was begun
      afresh, effected, consummated. Over yonder lay the bodies, dead, one atop
      of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched woman, to what monstrous perversity have you fallen! And how
      much blood there is upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By an effort of supreme pride Constance was able to draw herself up and
      even increase her stature, still wishing to conquer, and cry aloud that
      she was indeed the murderess, that she had always thwarted him, and would
      ever do so. But Mathieu was already overwhelming her with a final
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, then, that that ruffian, Alexandre, was one of the
      murderers of your friend, Madame Angelin, the poor woman who was robbed
      and strangled one winter afternoon. I compassionately hid that from you.
      But he would now be at the galleys had I spoken out! And if I were to
      speak to-day you would be there too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the hatchet-stroke. She did not speak, but dropped, all of a
      lump, upon the carpet, like a tree which has been felled. This time her
      defeat was complete; destiny, which she awaited, had turned against her
      and thrown her to the ground. A mother the less, perverted by the love
      which she had set on her one child, a mother duped, robbed, and maddened,
      who had glided into murder amid the dementia born of inconsolable
      motherliness! And now she lay there, stretched out, scraggy and withered,
      poisoned by the affection which she had been unable to bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu became anxious, and summoned the old servant, who, after procuring
      assistance, carried her mistress to her bed and then undressed her.
      Meantime, as Constance gave no sign of life, seized as she was by one of
      those fainting fits which often left her quite breathless, Mathieu himself
      went for Boutan, and meeting him just as he was returning home for dinner,
      was luckily able to bring him back at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boutan, who was now nearly seventy-two, and was quietly spending his last
      years in serene cheerfulness, born of his hope in life, had virtually
      ceased practising, only attending a very few old patients, his friends.
      However, he did not refuse Mathieu&rsquo;s request. When he had examined
      Constance he made a gesture of hopelessness, the meaning of which was so
      plain that Mathieu, his anxiety increasing, bethought himself of trying to
      find Beauchene in order that the latter might, at least, be present if his
      wife should die. But the old servant, on being questioned, began by
      raising her arms to heaven. She did not know where Monsieur might be,
      Monsieur never left any address. At last, feeling frightened herself, she
      made up her mind to hasten to the abode of the two women, aunt and niece,
      with whom Beauchene spent the greater part of his time. She knew their
      address perfectly well, as her mistress had even sent her thither in
      pressing emergencies. But she learnt that the ladies had gone with
      Monsieur to Nice for a holiday; whereupon, not desiring to return without
      some member of the family, she was seized on her way back with the fine
      idea of calling on Monsieur&rsquo;s sister, the Baroness de Lowicz, whom she
      brought, almost by force, in her cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Boutan attempted treatment. When Constance opened her
      eyes again, she looked at him fixedly, recognized him, no doubt, and then
      lowered her eyelids. And from that moment she obstinately refused to reply
      to any question that was put to her. She must have heard and have known
      that people were there, trying to succor her. But she would have none of
      their succor, she was stubbornly intent on dying, on giving no further
      sign of life. Neither did she raise her eyelids, nor did her lips part
      again. It was as if she had already quitted the world amid the mute agony
      of her defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Seraphine&rsquo;s manner was extremely strange. She reeked of
      ether, for she drank ether now. When she heard of the two-fold &ldquo;accident,&rdquo;
       the death of Morange and that of Alexandre, which had brought on
      Constance&rsquo;s cardiacal attack, she simply gave an insane grin, a kind of
      involuntary snigger, and stammered: &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though she removed neither her hat nor her gloves, she installed herself
      in an armchair, where she sat waiting, with her eyes wide open and staring
      straight before her&mdash;those brown eyes flecked with gold, whose living
      light was all that she had retained of her massacred beauty. At sixty-two
      she looked like a centenarian; her bold, insolent face was ravined, as it
      were, by her stormy life, and the glow of her sun-like hair had been
      extinguished by a shower of ashes. And time went on, midnight approached,
      and she was still there, near that death-bed of which she seemed to be
      ignorant, in that quivering chamber where she forgot herself, similar to a
      mere thing, apparently no longer even knowing why she had been brought
      thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Boutan had been unwilling to retire. Since Monsieur was at
      Nice in the company of those ladies, the aunt and the niece, they decided
      to spend the night there in order that Constance might not be left alone
      with the old servant. And towards midnight, while they were chatting
      together in undertones, they were suddenly stupefied at hearing Seraphine
      raise her voice, after preserving silence for three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead, you know,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was dead? At last they understood that she referred to Dr. Gaude. The
      celebrated surgeon, had, indeed, been found in his consulting-room struck
      down by sudden death, the cause of which was not clearly known. In fact,
      the strangest, the most horrible and tragical stories were current on the
      subject. According to one of them a patient had wreaked vengeance on the
      doctor; and Mathieu, full of emotion, recalled that one day, long ago,
      Seraphine herself had suggested that all Gaude&rsquo;s unhappy patients ought to
      band themselves together and put an end to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Seraphine perceived that Mathieu was gazing at her, as in a
      nightmare, moved by the shuddering silence of that death-watch, she once
      more grinned like a lunatic, and said: &ldquo;He is dead, we were all there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was insane, improbable, impossible; and yet was it true or was it
      false? A cold, terrifying quiver swept by, the icy quiver of mystery, of
      that which one knows not, which one will never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boutan leant towards Mathieu and whispered in his ear: &ldquo;She will be raving
      mad and shut up in a padded cell before a week is over.&rdquo; And, indeed, a
      week later the Baroness de Lowicz was wearing a straight waistcoat. In her
      case Dr. Gaude&rsquo;s treatment had led to absolute insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Boutan watched beside Constance until daybreak. She never
      opened her lips, nor raised her eyelids. As the sun rose up, she turned
      towards the wall, and then she died.

    <p>
      STILL more years passed, and Mathieu was already sixty-eight and Marianne
      sixty-five, when amid the increasing good fortune which they owed to their
      faith in life, and their long courageous hopefulness, a last battle, the
      most dolorous of their existence, almost struck them down and sent them to
      the grave, despairing and inconsolable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Marianne went to bed, quivering, utterly distracted. Quite a
      rending was taking place in the family. A disastrous and hateful quarrel
      had set the mill, where Gregoire reigned supreme, against the farm which
      was managed by Gervais and Claire. And Ambroise, on being selected as
      arbiter, had fanned the flames by judging the affair in a purely business
      way from his Paris counting-house, without taking into account the various
      passions which were kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on returning from a secret application to Ambroise, prompted by a
      maternal longing for peace, that Marianne had taken to her bed, wounded to
      the heart, and terrified by the thought of the future. Ambroise had
      received her roughly, almost brutally, and she had gone back home in a
      state of intense anguish, feeling as if her own flesh were lacerated by
      the quarrelling of her ungrateful sons. And she had kept her bed, begging
      Mathieu to say nothing, and explaining that a doctor&rsquo;s services would be
      useless, since she did not suffer from any malady. She was fading away,
      however, as he could well detect; she was day by day taking leave of him,
      carried off by her bitter grief. Was it possible that all those loving and
      well-loved children, who had grown up under their care and their caresses,
      who had become the joy and pride of their victory, all those children born
      of their love, united in their fidelity, a sacred brotherly, sisterly
      battalion gathered close around them, was it possible that they should now
      disband and desperately seek to destroy one another? If so, it was true,
      then, that the more a family increases, the greater is the harvest of
      ingratitude. And still more accurate became the saying, that to judge of
      any human being&rsquo;s happiness or unhappiness in life, one must wait until he
      be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mathieu, as he sat near Marianne&rsquo;s bed, holding her feverish
      hand, &ldquo;to think of it! To have struggled so much, and to have triumphed so
      much, and then to encounter this supreme grief, which will bring us more
      pain than all the others. Decidedly it is true that one must continue
      battling until one&rsquo;s last breath, and that happiness is only to be won by
      suffering and tears. We must still hope, still triumph, and conquer and
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, however, had lost all courage, and seemed to be overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have no energy left me, I am vanquished. I was always
      able to heal the wounds which came from without, but this wound comes from
      my own blood; my blood pours forth within me and stifles me. All our work
      is destroyed. Our joy, our health, our strength, have at the last day
      become mere lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu, whom her grievous fears of a disaster gained, went off to
      weep in the adjoining room, already picturing his wife dead and himself in
      utter solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with reference to Lepailleur&rsquo;s moorland, the plots intersecting the
      Chantebled estate, that the wretched quarrel had broken out between the
      mill and the farm. For many years already, the romantic, ivy-covered old
      mill, with its ancient mossy wheel, had ceased to exist. Gregoire, at last
      putting his father&rsquo;s ideas into execution, had thrown it down to replace
      it by a large steam mill, with spacious meal-stores which a light
      railway-line connected with Janville station. And he himself, since he had
      been making a big fortune&mdash;for all the wheat of the district was now
      sent to him&mdash;had greatly changed, with nothing of his youthful
      turbulence left save a quick temper, which his wife Therese with her
      brave, loving heart alone could somewhat calm. On a score of occasions he
      had almost broken off all relations with his father-in-law, Lepailleur,
      who certainly abused his seventy years. Though the old miller, in spite of
      all his prophecies of ruin, had been unable to prevent the building of the
      new establishment, he none the less sneered and jeered at it, exasperated
      as he was at having been in the wrong. He had, in fact, been beaten for
      the second time. Not only did the prodigious crops of Chantebled disprove
      his theory of the bankruptcy of the earth, that villainous earth in which,
      like an obstinate peasant weary of toil and eager for speedy fortune, he
      asserted nothing more would grow; but now that mill of his, which he had
      so disdained, was born as it were afresh, growing to a gigantic size, and
      becoming in his son-in-law&rsquo;s hands an instrument of great wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst was that Lepailleur so stubbornly lived on, experiencing
      continual defeats, but never willing to acknowledge that he was beaten.
      One sole delight remained to him, the promise given and kept by Gregoire
      that he would not sell the moorland enclosure to the farm. The old man had
      even prevailed on him to leave it uncultivated, and the sight of that
      sterile tract intersecting the wavy greenery of the beautiful estate of
      Chantebled, like a spot of desolation, well pleased his spiteful nature.
      He was often to be seen strolling there, like an old king of the stones
      and the brambles, drawing up his tall, scraggy figure as if he were quite
      proud of the poverty of that soil. In going thither one of his objects
      doubtless was to find a pretext for a quarrel; for it was he who in the
      course of one of these promenades, when he displayed such provoking
      insolence, discovered an encroachment on the part of the farm&mdash;an
      encroachment which his comments magnified to such a degree that disastrous
      consequences seemed probable. As it was, all the happiness of the Froments
      was for a time destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In business matters Gregoire invariably showed the rough impulsiveness of
      a man of sanguine temperament, obstinately determined to part with no
      fraction of his rights. When his father-in-law told him that the farm had
      impudently cleared some seven acres of his moorland, with the intention no
      doubt of carrying this fine robbery even further, if it were not promptly
      stopped, Gregoire at once decided to inquire into the matter, declaring
      that he would not tolerate any invasion of that sort. The misfortune then
      was that no boundary stones could be found. Thus, the people of the farm
      might assert that they had made a mistake in all good faith, or even that
      they had remained within their limits. But Lepailleur ragefully maintained
      the contrary, entered into particulars, and traced what he declared to be
      the proper frontier line with his stick, swearing that within a few inches
      it was absolutely correct. However, matters went altogether from bad to
      worse after an interview between the brothers, Gervais and Gregoire, in
      the course of which the latter lost his temper and indulged in
      unpardonable language. On the morrow, too, he began an action-at-law, to
      which Gervais replied by threatening that he would not send another grain
      of corn to be ground at the mill. And this rupture of business relations
      meant serious consequences for the mill, which really owed its prosperity
      to the custom of Chantebled.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment matters grew worse each day, and conciliation soon seemed
      to be out of the question; for Ambroise, on being solicited to find a
      basis of agreement, became in his turn impassioned, and even ended by
      enraging both parties. Thus the hateful ravages of that fratricidal war
      were increased: there were now three brothers up in arms against one
      another. And did not this forebode the end of everything; might not this
      destructive fury gain the whole family, overwhelming it as with a blast of
      folly and hatred after so many years of sterling good sense and strong and
      healthy affection?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu naturally tried to intervene. But at the very outset he felt that
      if he should fail, if his paternal authority should be disregarded, the
      disaster would become irreparable. Without renouncing the struggle, he
      therefore waited for some opportunity which he might turn to good account.
      At the same time, each successive day of discord increased his anxiety. It
      was really all his own life-work, the little people which had sprung from
      him, the little kingdom which he had founded under the benevolent sun,
      that was threatened with sudden ruin. A work such as this can only live by
      force of love. The love which created it can alone perpetuate it; it
      crumbles as soon as the bond of fraternal solidarity is broken. Thus it
      seemed to Mathieu that instead of leaving his work behind him in full
      florescence of kindliness, joy, and vigor, he would see it cast to the
      ground in fragments, soiled, and dead even before he were dead himself.
      Yet what a fruitful and prosperous work had hitherto been that estate of
      Chantebled, whose overflowing fertility increased at each successive
      harvest; and that mill too, so enlarged and so flourishing, which was the
      outcome of his own inspiring suggestions, to say nothing of the prodigious
      fortunes which his conquering sons had acquired in Paris! Yet it was all
      this admirable work, which faith in life had created, that a fratricidal
      onslaught upon life was about to destroy!
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, in the mournful gloaming of one of the last days of
      September, the couch on which Marianne lay dying of silent grief was, by
      her desire, rolled to the window. Charlotte alone nursed her, and of all
      her sons she had but the last one, Benjamin, beside her in the now
      over-spacious house which had replaced the old shooting-box. Since the
      family had been at war she had kept the doors closed, intent on opening
      them only to her children when they became reconciled, if they should then
      seek to make her happy by coming to embrace one another beneath her roof.
      But she virtually despaired of that sole cure for her grief, the only joy
      that would make her live again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as Mathieu came to sit beside her, and they lingered there
      hand in hand according to their wont, they did not at first speak, but
      gazed straight before them at the spreading plain; at the estate, whose
      interminable fields blended with the mist far away; at the mill yonder on
      the banks of the Yeuse, with its tall, smoking chimney; and at Paris
      itself on the horizon, where a tawny cloud was rising as from the huge
      furnace of some forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes slowly passed away. During the afternoon Mathieu had taken a
      long walk in the direction of the farms of Mareuil and Lillebonne, in the
      hope of quieting his torment by physical fatigue. And in a low voice, as
      if speaking to himself, he at last said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ploughing could not take place under better conditions. Yonder on the
      plateau the quality of the soil has been much improved by the recent
      methods of cultivation; and here, too, on the slopes, the sandy soil has
      been greatly enriched by the new distribution of the springs which Gervais
      devised. The estate has almost doubled in value since it has been in his
      hands and Claire&rsquo;s. There is no break in the prosperity; labor yields
      unlimited victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of it if there is no more love?&rdquo; murmured Marianne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, too,&rdquo; continued Mathieu, after a pause, &ldquo;I went down to the Yeuse,
      and from a distance I saw that Gregoire had received the new machine which
      Denis has just built for him. It was being unloaded in the yard. It seems
      that it imparts a certain movement to the mill-stones, which saves a good
      third of the power needed. With such appliances the earth may produce seas
      of corn for innumerable nations, they will all have bread. And that
      mill-engine, with its regular breath and motion, will produce fresh wealth
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What use is it if people hate one another?&rdquo; Marianne exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Mathieu dropped the subject. But, in accordance with a resolution
      which he had formed during his walk, he told his wife that he meant to go
      to Paris on the morrow. And on noticing her surprise, he pretended that he
      wished to see to a certain business matter, the settlement of an old
      account. But the truth was, that he could no longer endure the spectacle
      of his wife&rsquo;s lingering agony, which brought him so much suffering. He
      wished to act, to make a supreme effort at reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, when Mathieu alighted from the
      train at the Paris terminus, he drove direct to the factory at Grenelle.
      Before everything else he wished to see Denis, who had hitherto taken no
      part in the quarrel. For a long time now, indeed ever since Constance&rsquo;s
      death, Denis had been installed in the house on the quay with his wife
      Marthe and their three children. This occupation of the luxurious dwelling
      set apart for the master had been like a final entry into possession, with
      respect to the whole works. True, Beauchene had lived several years
      longer, but his name no longer figured in that of the firm. He had
      surrendered his last shred of interest in the business for an annuity; and
      at last one evening it was learnt that he had died that day, struck down
      by an attack of apoplexy after an over-copious lunch, at the residence of
      his lady-friends, the aunt and the niece. He had previously been sinking
      into a state of second childhood, the outcome of his life of fast and
      furious pleasure. And this, then, was the end of the egotistical
      debauchee, ever going from bad to worse, and finally swept into the
      gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what good wind has blown you here?&rdquo; cried Denis gayly, when he
      perceived his father. &ldquo;Have you come to lunch? I&rsquo;m still a bachelor, you
      know; for it is only next Monday that I shall go to fetch Marthe and the
      children from Dieppe, where they have spent a delightful September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on hearing that his mother was ailing, even in danger, he become
      serious and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma ill, and in danger! You amaze me. I thought she was simply troubled
      with some little indisposition. But come, father, what is really the
      matter? Are you hiding something? Is something worrying you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he listened to the plain and detailed statement which Mathieu
      felt obliged to make to him. And he was deeply moved by it, as if the
      dread of the catastrophe which it foreshadowed would henceforth upset his
      life. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he angrily exclaimed, &ldquo;my brothers are up to these fine
      pranks with their idiotic quarrel! I knew that they did not get on well
      together. I had heard of things which saddened me, but I never imagined
      that matters had gone so far, and that you and mamma were so affected that
      you had shut yourselves up and were dying of it all! But things must be
      set to rights! One must see Ambroise at once. Let us go and lunch with
      him, and finish the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before starting he had a few orders to give, so Mathieu went down to wait
      for him in the factory yard. And there, during the ten minutes which he
      spent walking about dreamily, all the distant past arose before his eyes.
      He could see himself a mere clerk, crossing that courtyard every morning
      on his arrival from Janville, with thirty sous for his lunch in his
      pocket. The spot had remained much the same; there was the central
      building, with its big clock, the workshops and the sheds, quite a little
      town of gray structures, surmounted by two lofty chimneys, which were ever
      smoking. True, his son had enlarged this city of toil; the stretch of
      ground bordered by the Rue de la Federation and the Boulevard de Grenelle
      had been utilized for the erection of other buildings. And facing the quay
      there still stood the large brick house with dressings of white stone, of
      which Constance had been so proud, and where, with the mien of some queen
      of industry, she had received her friends in her little salon hung with
      yellow silk. Eight hundred men now worked in the place; the ground
      quivered with the ceaseless trepidation of machinery; the establishment
      had grown to be the most important of its kind in Paris, the one whence
      came the finest agricultural appliances, the most powerful mechanical
      workers of the soil. And it was his, Mathieu&rsquo;s, son whom fortune had made
      prince of that branch of industry, and it was his daughter-in-law who,
      with her three strong, healthy children near her, received her friends in
      the little salon hung with yellow silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mathieu, moved by his recollections, glanced towards the right, towards
      the pavilion where he had dwelt with Marianne, and where Gervais had been
      born, an old workman who passed, lifted his cap to him, saying, &ldquo;Good day,
      Monsieur Froment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu thereupon recognized Victor Moineaud, now five-and-fifty years
      old, and aged, and wrecked by labor to even a greater degree than his
      father had been at the time when mother Moineaud had come to offer the
      Monster her children&rsquo;s immature flesh. Entering the works at sixteen years
      of age, Victor, like his father, had spent forty years between the forge
      and the anvil. It was iniquitous destiny beginning afresh: the most
      crushing toil falling upon a beast of burden, the son hebetated after the
      father, ground to death under the millstones of wretchedness and
      injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Victor,&rdquo; said Mathieu, &ldquo;are you well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m no longer young, Monsieur Froment,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;I shall
      soon have to look somewhere for a hole to lie in. Still, I hope it won&rsquo;t
      be under an omnibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He alluded to the death of his father, who had finally been picked up
      under an omnibus in the Rue de Grenelle, with his skull split and both
      legs broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; resumed Victor, &ldquo;one may as well die that way as any
      other! It&rsquo;s even quicker. The old man was lucky in having Norine and
      Cecile to look after him. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for them, it&rsquo;s starvation that
      would have killed him, not an omnibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu interrupted. &ldquo;Are Norine and Cecile well?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Froment. Leastways, as far as I know, for, as you can
      understand, we don&rsquo;t often see one another. Them and me, that&rsquo;s about all
      that&rsquo;s left out of our lot; for Irma won&rsquo;t have anything more to do with
      us since she&rsquo;s become one of the toffs. Euphrasie was lucky enough to die,
      and that brigand Alfred disappeared, which was real relief, I assure you;
      for I feared that I should be seeing him at the galleys. And I was really
      pleased when I had some news of Norine and Cecile lately. Norine is older
      than I am, you know; she will soon be sixty. But she was always strong,
      and her boy, it seems, looks after her. Both she and Cecile still work;
      yes, Cecile still lives on, though one used to think that a fillip would
      have killed her. It&rsquo;s a pretty home, that one of theirs; two mothers for a
      big lad of whom they&rsquo;ve made a decent fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu nodded approvingly, and then remarked: &ldquo;But you yourself, Victor,
      had boys and girls who must now in their turn be fathers and mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old workman waved his hand vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had eight, one more than my father. They&rsquo;ve all gone
      off, and they are fathers and mothers in their turn, as you say, Monsieur
      Froment. It&rsquo;s all chance, you know; one has to live. There are some of
      them who certainly don&rsquo;t eat white bread, ah! that they don&rsquo;t. And the
      question is whether, when my arms fail me, I shall find one to take me in,
      as Norine and Cecile took my father. But when everything&rsquo;s said, what can
      you expect? It&rsquo;s all seed of poverty, it can&rsquo;t grow well, or yield
      anything good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he remained silent; then resuming his walk towards the works,
      with bent, weary back and hanging hands, dented by toil, he said: &ldquo;Au
      revoir, Monsieur Froment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir, Victor,&rdquo; Mathieu answered in a kindly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given his orders, Denis now came to join his father, and proposed
      to him that they should go on foot to the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin. On the way he
      warned him that they would certainly find Ambroise alone, for his wife and
      four children were still at Dieppe, where, indeed, the two sisters-in-law,
      Andree and Marthe, had spent the season together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a period of ten years, Ambroise&rsquo;s fortune had increased tenfold. Though
      he was barely five-and-forty, he reigned over the Paris market. With his
      spirit of enterprise, he had greatly enlarged the business left him by old
      Du Hordel, transforming it into a really universal <i>comptoir</i>,
      through which passed merchandise from all parts of the world. Frontiers
      did not exist for Ambroise, he enriched himself with the spoils of the
      earth, particularly striving to extract from the colonies all the wealth
      they were able to yield, and carrying on his operations with such
      triumphant audacity, such keen perception, that the most hazardous of his
      campaigns ended victoriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of this stamp, whose fruitful activity was ever winning battles, was
      certain to devour the idle, impotent Seguins. In the downfall of their
      fortune, the dispersal of the home and family, he had carved a share for
      himself by securing possession of the house in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin. Seguin
      himself had not resided there for years, he had thought it original to
      live at his club, where he secured accommodation after he and his wife had
      separated by consent. Two of the children had also gone off; Gaston, now a
      major in the army, was on duty in a distant garrison town, and Lucie was
      cloistered in an Ursuline convent. Thus, Valentine, left to herself and
      feeling very dreary, no longer able, moreover, to keep up the
      establishment on a proper footing, in her turn quitted the mansion for a
      cheerful and elegant little flat on the Boulevard Malesherbes, where she
      finished her life as a very devout old lady, presiding over a society for
      providing poor mothers with baby-linen, and thus devoting herself to the
      children of others&mdash;she who had not known how to bring up her own.
      And, in this wise, Ambroise had simply had to take possession of the empty
      mansion, which was heavily mortgaged, to such an extent, indeed, that when
      the Seguins died their heirs would certainly be owing him money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the recollections which awoke when Mathieu, accompanied by
      Denis, entered that princely mansion of the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin! There, as at
      the factory, he could see himself arriving in poverty, as a needy tenant
      begging his landlord to repair a roof, in order that the rain might no
      longer pour down on the four children, whom, with culpable improvidence,
      he already had to provide for. There, facing the avenue, was the sumptuous
      Renaissance facade with eight lofty windows on each of its upper floors;
      there, inside, was the hall, all bronze and marble, conducting to the
      spacious ground-floor reception-rooms which a winter garden prolonged; and
      there, up above, occupying all the central part of the first floor, was
      Seguin&rsquo;s former &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; the vast apartment with lofty windows of old
      stained glass. Mathieu could well remember that room with its profuse and
      amusing display of &ldquo;antiquities,&rdquo; old brocades, old goldsmith&rsquo;s ware and
      old pottery, and its richly bound books, and its famous modern pewters.
      And he remembered it also at a later date, in the abandonment to which it
      had fallen, the aspect of ruin which it had assumed, covered, as it was,
      with gray dust which bespoke the slow crumbling of the home. And now he
      found it once more superb and cheerful, renovated with healthier and more
      substantial luxury by Ambroise, who had put masons and joiners and
      upholsterers into it for a period of three months. The whole mansion now
      lived afresh, more luxurious than ever, filled at winter-time with sounds
      of festivity, enlivened by the laughter of four happy children, and the
      blaze of a living fortune which effort and conquest ever renewed. And it
      was no longer Seguin, the idler, the artisan of nothingness, whom Mathieu
      came to see there, it was his own son Ambroise, a man of creative energy,
      whose victory had been sought by the very forces of life, which had made
      him triumph there, installed him as the master in the home of the
      vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mathieu and Denis arrived Ambroise was absent, but was expected home
      for lunch. They waited for him, and as the former again crossed the
      ante-room the better to judge of some new arrangements that had been made,
      he was surprised at being stopped by a lady who was sitting there
      patiently, and whom he had not previously noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that Monsieur Froment does not recognize me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu made a vague gesture. The woman had a tall, plump figure, and was
      certainly more than sixty years of age; but she evidently took care of her
      person, and had a smiling mien, with a long, full face and almost
      venerable white hair. One might have taken her for some worthy, well-to-do
      provincial bourgeoise in full dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Celeste, Madame Seguin&rsquo;s former maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he fully recognized her, but hid his stupefaction at finding her
      so fortunately circumstanced at the close of her career. He had imagined
      that she was buried in some sewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a gay, placid way she proceeded to recount her happiness: &ldquo;Oh! I am
      very pleased,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I had retired to Rougemont, my birth-place, and
      I ended by there marrying a retired naval officer, who has a very
      comfortable pension, not to speak of a little fortune which his first wife
      left him. As he has two big sons, I ventured to recommend the younger one
      to Monsieur Ambroise, who was kind enough to take him into his
      counting-house. And so I have profited by my first journey to Paris since
      then, to come and give Monsieur Ambroise my best thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not say how she had managed to marry the retired naval officer;
      how she had originally been a servant in his household, and how she had
      hastened his first wife&rsquo;s death in order to marry him. All things
      considered, however, she rendered him very happy, and even rid him of his
      sons, who were in his way, thanks to the relations she had kept up in
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued smiling like a worthy woman, whose feelings softened at the
      recollection of the past. &ldquo;You can have no idea how pleased I felt when I
      saw you pass just now, Monsieur Froment,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;Ah! it was a long
      time ago that I first had the honor of seeing you here! You remember La
      Couteau, don&rsquo;t you? She was always complaining, was she not? But she is
      very well pleased now; she and her husband have retired to a pretty little
      house of their own, with some little savings which they live on very
      quietly. She is no longer young, but she has buried a good many in her
      time, and she&rsquo;ll bury more before she has finished! For instance, Madame
      Menoux&mdash;you must surely remember Madame Menoux, the little
      haberdasher close by&mdash;well, there was a woman now who never had any
      luck! She lost her second child, and she lost that big fellow, her
      husband, whom she was so fond of, and she herself died of grief six months
      afterwards. I did at one time think of taking her to Rougemont, where the
      air is so good for one&rsquo;s health. There are old folks of ninety living
      there. Take La Couteau, for instance, she will live as long as she likes!
      Oh! yes, it is a very pleasant part indeed, a perfect paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the abominable Rougemont, the bloody Rougemont, arose
      before Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes, rearing its peaceful steeple above the low plain,
      with its cemetery paved with little Parisians, where wild flowers bloomed
      and hid the victims of so many murders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Celeste was rattling on again, saying: &ldquo;You remember Madame Bourdieu
      whom you used to know in the Rue de Miromesnil; she died very near our
      village on some property where she went to live when she gave up business,
      a good many years ago. She was luckier than her colleague La Rouche, who
      was far too good-natured with people. You must have read about her case in
      the newspapers, she was sent to prison with a medical man named
      Sarraille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Rouche! Sarraille!&rdquo; Yes, Mathieu had certainly read the trial of those
      two social pests, who were fated to meet at last in their work of
      iniquity. And what an echo did those names awaken in the past: Valerie
      Morange! Reine Morange! Already in the factory yard Mathieu had fancied
      that he could see the shadow of Morange gliding past him&mdash;the
      punctual, timid, soft-hearted accountant, whom misfortune and insanity had
      carried off into the darkness. And suddenly the unhappy man here again
      appeared to Mathieu, like a wandering phantom, the restless victim of all
      the imbecile ambition, all the desperate craving for pleasure which
      animated the period; a poor, weak, mediocre being, so cruelly punished for
      the crimes of others, that he was doubtless unable to sleep in the tomb
      into which he had flung himself, bleeding, with broken limbs. And before
      Mathieu&rsquo;s eyes there likewise passed the spectre of Seraphine, with the
      fierce and pain-fraught face of one who is racked and killed by insatiate
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, excuse me for having ventured to stop you, Monsieur Froment,&rdquo;
       Celeste concluded; &ldquo;but I am very, very pleased at having met you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still looking at her; and as he quitted her he said, with the
      indulgence born of his optimism: &ldquo;May you keep happy since you are happy.
      Happiness must know what it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Mathieu remained disturbed, as he thought of the apparent
      injustice of impassive nature. The memory of his Marianne, struck down by
      such deep grief, pining away through the impious quarrels of her sons,
      returned to him. And as Ambroise at last came in and gayly embraced him,
      after receiving Celeste&rsquo;s thanks, he felt a thrill of anguish, for the
      decisive moment which would save or wreck the family was now at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Denis, after inviting himself and Mathieu to lunch, promptly
      plunged into the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not here for the mere pleasure of lunching with you,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;mamma is ill, did you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill?&rdquo; said Ambroise. &ldquo;Not seriously ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very ill, in danger. And are you aware that she has been ill like
      this ever since she came to speak to you about the quarrel between
      Gregoire and Gervais, when it seems that you treated her very roughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I treated her roughly? We simply talked business, and perhaps I spoke to
      her like a business man, a little bluntly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Ambroise turned towards Mathieu, who was waiting, pale and silent:
      &ldquo;Is it true, father, that mamma is ill and causes you anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as his father replied with a long affirmative nod, he gave vent to his
      emotion, even as Denis had done at the works immediately on learning the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dash it all,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this affair is becoming quite idiotic! In my
      opinion Gregoire is right and Gervais wrong. Only I don&rsquo;t care a fig about
      that; they must make it up at once, so that poor mamma may not have
      another moment&rsquo;s suffering. But then, why did you shut yourselves up? Why
      did you not let us know how grieved you were? Every one would have
      reflected and understood things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, Ambroise embraced his father with that promptness of
      decision which he displayed to such happy effect in business as soon as
      ever a ray of light illumined his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, father,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you are the cleverest; you understand
      things and foresee them. Even if Gregoire were within his rights in
      bringing an action against Gervais, it would be idiotic for him to do so,
      because far above any petty private interest, there is the interest of all
      of us, the interest of the family, which is to remain, united, compact,
      and unattackable, if it desires to continue invincible. Our sovereign
      strength lies in our union&mdash;And so it&rsquo;s simple enough. We will lunch
      as quickly as possible and take the first train. We shall go, Denis and I,
      to Chantebled with you. Peace must be concluded this evening. I will see
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughing, and well pleased to find his own feelings shared by his two
      sons, Mathieu returned Ambroise&rsquo;s embrace. And while waiting for lunch to
      be served, they went down to see the winter garden, which was being
      enlarged for some fetes which Ambroise wished to give. He took pleasure in
      adding to the magnificence of the mansion, and in reigning there with
      princely pomp. At lunch he apologized for only offering his father and
      brother a bachelor&rsquo;s pot-luck, though, truth to tell, the fare was
      excellent. Indeed, whenever Andree and the children absented themselves,
      Ambroise still kept a good cook to minister to his needs, for he held the
      cuisine of restaurants in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;I go to a restaurant for my meals; for
      since Marthe and all the others have been at Dieppe, I have virtually shut
      up the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wise man, you see,&rdquo; Ambroise answered, with quiet frankness.
      &ldquo;For my part, as you are aware, I am an enjoyer. Now, make haste and drink
      your coffee, and we will start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached Janville by the two o&rsquo;clock train. Their plan was to repair
      to Chantebled in the first instance, in order that Ambroise and Denis
      might begin by talking to Gervais, who was of a gentler nature than
      Gregoire, and with whom they thought they might devise some means of
      conciliation. Then they intended to betake themselves to the mill, lecture
      Gregoire, and impose on him such peace conditions as they might have
      agreed upon. As they drew nearer and nearer to the farm, however, the
      difficulties of their undertaking appeared to them, and seemed to increase
      in magnitude. An arrangement would not be arrived at so easily as they had
      at first imagined. So they girded their loins in readiness for a hard
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we begin by going to see mamma,&rdquo; Denis suggested. &ldquo;We should see
      and embrace her, and that would give us some courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ambroise deemed the idea an excellent one. &ldquo;Yes, let us go by all means,
      particularly as mamma has always been a good counsellor. She must have
      some idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They climbed to the first floor of the house, to the spacious room where
      Marianne spent her days on a couch beside the window. And to their
      stupefaction they found her seated on that couch with Gregoire standing by
      her and holding both her hands, while on the other side were Gervais and
      Claire, laughing softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what is this?&rdquo; exclaimed Ambroise in amazement. &ldquo;The work is done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we who despaired of being able to accomplish it!&rdquo; declared Denis,
      with a gesture of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu was equally stupefied and delighted, and on noticing the surprise
      occasioned by the arrival of the two big brothers from Paris, he proceeded
      to explain the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Paris this morning to fetch them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve brought
      them here to reconcile us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A joyous peal of laughter resounded. The big brothers were too late!
      Neither their wisdom nor their diplomacy had been needed. They themselves
      made merry over it, feeling the while greatly relieved that the victory
      should have been won without any battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne, whose eyes were moist, and who felt divinely happy, so happy
      that she seemed already well again, simply replied to Mathieu: &ldquo;You see,
      my friend, it&rsquo;s done. But as yet I know nothing further. Gregoire came
      here and kissed me, and wished me to send for Gervais and Claire at once.
      Then, of his own accord, he told them that they were all three mad in
      causing me such grief, and that they ought to come to an understanding
      together. Thereupon they kissed one another. And now it&rsquo;s done; it&rsquo;s all
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gregoire gayly intervened. &ldquo;Wait a moment; just listen; I cut too fine
      a figure in the story as mamma relates it, and I must tell you the truth.
      I wasn&rsquo;t the first to desire the reconciliation; the first was my wife,
      Therese. She has a good sterling heart and the very brains of a mule, in
      such wise that whenever she is determined on anything I always have to do
      it in the end. Well, yesterday evening we had a bit of a quarrel, for she
      had heard, I don&rsquo;t know how, that mamma was ill with grief. And this
      pained her, and she tried to prove to me how stupid the quarrel was, for
      we should all of us lose by it. This morning she began again, and of
      course she convinced me, more particularly as, with the thought of poor
      mamma lying ill through our fault, I had hardly slept all night. But
      father Lepailleur still had to be convinced, and Therese undertook to do
      that also. She even hit upon something extraordinary, so that the old man
      might imagine that he was the conqueror of conquerors. She persuaded him
      at last to sell you that terrible enclosure at such an insane price that
      he will be able to shout &lsquo;victory!&rsquo; over all the house-tops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to his brother and sister, Gregoire added, in a jocular tone;
      &ldquo;My dear Gervais, my dear Claire, let yourselves be robbed, I beg of you.
      The peace of my home is at stake. Give my father-in-law the last joy of
      believing that he alone has always been in the right, and that we have
      never been anything but fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as much money as he likes,&rdquo; replied Gervais, laughing. &ldquo;Besides, that
      enclosure has always been a dishonor for the estate, streaking it with
      stones and brambles, like a nasty sore. We have long dreamt of seeing the
      property spotless, with its crops waving without a break under the sun.
      And Chantebled is rich enough to pay for its glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the affair was settled. The wheat of the farm would return to the
      mill to be ground, and the mother would get well again. It was the force
      of life, the need of love, the union necessary for the whole family if it
      were to continue victorious, that had imposed true brotherliness on the
      sons, who for a moment had been foolish enough to destroy their power by
      assailing one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delight of finding themselves once more together there, Denis,
      Ambroise, Gervais, Gregoire, the four big brothers, and Claire, the big
      sister, all reconciled and again invincible, increased when Charlotte
      arrived, bringing with her the other three daughters, Louise, Madeleine,
      and Marthe, who had married and settled in the district. Louise, having
      heard that her mother was ill, had gone to fetch her sisters, in order
      that they might repair to Chantebled together. And what a hearty laugh
      there was when the procession entered!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them all come!&rdquo; cried Ambroise, in a jocular way. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the
      family complete, a real meeting of the great privy council. You see,
      mamma, you must get well at once; the whole of your court is at your
      knees, and unanimously decides that it can no longer allow you to have
      even a headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Benjamin put in an appearance the very last, behind the three
      sisters, the laughter broke out afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that we were forgetting Benjamin!&rdquo; Mathieu exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, little one, come and kiss me in your turn,&rdquo; said Marianne
      affectionately, in a low voice. &ldquo;The others jest because you are the last
      of the brood. But if I spoil you that only concerns ourselves, does it
      not? Tell them that you spent the morning with me, and that if you went
      out for a walk it was because I wished you to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin smiled with a gentle and rather sad expression. &ldquo;But I was
      downstairs, mamma; I saw them go up one after the other. I waited for them
      all to kiss, before coming up in my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already one-and-twenty and extremely handsome, with a bright face,
      large brown eyes, long curly hair, and a frizzy, downy beard. Though he
      had never been ill, his mother would have it that he was weak, and
      insisted on coddling him. All of them, moreover, were very fond of him,
      both for his grace of person and the gentle charm of his disposition. He
      had grown up in a kind of dream, full of a desire which he could not put
      into words, ever seeking the unknown, something which he knew not, did not
      possess. And when his parents saw that he had no taste for any profession,
      and that even the idea of marrying did not appeal to him, they evinced no
      anger, but, on the contrary, they secretly plotted to keep this son, their
      last-born, life&rsquo;s final gift, to themselves. Had they not surrendered all
      the others? Would they not be forgiven for yielding to the egotism of love
      by reserving one for themselves, one who would be theirs entirely, who
      would never marry, or toil and moil, but would merely live beside them and
      love them, and be loved in return? This was the dream of their old age,
      the share which, in return for long fruitfulness, they would have liked to
      snatch from devouring life, which, though it gives one everything, yet
      takes everything away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! just listen, Benjamin,&rdquo; Ambroise suddenly resumed, &ldquo;you are
      interested in our brave Nicolas, I know. Would you like to have some news
      of him? I heard from him only the day before yesterday. And it&rsquo;s right
      that I should speak of him, since he&rsquo;s the only one of the brood, as mamma
      puts it, who cannot be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin at once became quite excited, asking, &ldquo;Is it true? Has he written
      to you? What does he say? What is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could never think without emotion of Nicolas&rsquo;s departure for Senegal.
      He was twelve years old at that time, and nearly nine years had gone by
      since then, yet the scene, with that eternal farewell, that flight, as it
      were, into the infinite of time and hope, was ever present in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I have business relations with Nicolas,&rdquo; resumed Ambroise.
      &ldquo;Oh! if we had but a few fellows as intelligent and courageous as he is in
      our colonies, we should soon rake in all the scattered wealth of those
      virgin lands. Well, Nicolas, as you are aware, went to Senegal with
      Lisbeth, who was the very companion and helpmate he needed. Thanks to the
      few thousand francs which they possessed between them, they soon
      established a prosperous business; but I divined that the field was still
      too small for them, and that they dreamt of clearing and conquering a
      larger expanse. And now, all at once, Nicolas writes to me that he is
      starting for the Soudan, the valley of the Niger, which has only lately
      been opened. He is taking his wife and his four children with him, and
      they are all going off to conquer as fortune may will it, like valiant
      pioneers beset by the idea of founding a new world. I confess that it
      amazes me, for it is a very hazardous enterprise. But all the same one
      must admit that our Nicolas is a very plucky fellow, and one can&rsquo;t help
      admiring his great energy and faith in thus setting out for an almost
      unknown region, fully convinced that he will subject and populate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell. A great gust seemed to have swept by, the gust of the
      infinite coming from the far away mysterious virgin plains. And the family
      could picture that young fellow, one of themselves, going off through the
      deserts, carrying the good seed of humanity under the spreading sky into
      unknown climes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Benjamin softly, his eyes dilating and gazing far, far away as
      if to the world&rsquo;s end; &ldquo;ah! he&rsquo;s happy, for he sees other rivers, and
      other forests, and other suns than ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Marianne shuddered. &ldquo;No, no, my boy,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;there are no other
      rivers than the Yeuse, no other forests but our woods of Lillebonne, no
      other sun but that of Chantebled. Come and kiss me again&mdash;let us all
      kiss once more, and I shall get well, and we shall never be parted again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laughter began afresh with the embraces. It was a great day, a day of
      victory, the most decisive victory which the family had ever won by
      refusing to let discord destroy it. Henceforth it would be invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twilight, on the evening of that day, Mathieu and Marianne again found
      themselves, as on the previous evening, hand in hand near the window
      whence they could see the estate stretching to the horizon; that horizon
      behind which arose the breath of Paris, the tawny cloud of its gigantic
      forge. But how little did that serene evening resemble the other, and how
      great was their present felicity, their trust in the goodness of their
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel better?&rdquo; Mathieu asked his wife; &ldquo;do you feel your strength
      returning; does your heart beat more freely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my friend, I feel cured; I was only pining with grief. To-morrow I
      shall be strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mathieu sank into a deep reverie, as he sat there face to face with
      his conquest&mdash;that estate which spread out under the setting sun. And
      again, as in the morning, did recollections crowd upon him; he remembered
      a morning more than forty years previously when he had left Marianne, with
      thirty sous in her purse, in the little tumbledown shooting-box on the
      verge of the woods. They lived there on next to nothing; they owed money,
      they typified gay improvidence with the four little mouths which they
      already had to feed, those children who had sprung from their love, their
      faith in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he recalled his return home at night time, the three hundred francs,
      a month&rsquo;s salary, which he had carried in his pocket, the calculations
      which he had made, the cowardly anxiety which he had felt, disturbed as he
      was by the poisonous egotism which he had encountered in Paris. There were
      the Beauchenes, with their factory, and their only son, Maurice, whom they
      were bringing up to be a future prince, the Beauchenes, who had prophesied
      to him that he and his wife and their troop of children could only expect
      a life of black misery, and death in a garret. There were also the
      Seguins, then his landlords, who had shown him their millions, and their
      magnificent mansion, full of treasures, crushing him the while, treating
      him with derisive pity because he did not behave sensibly like themselves,
      who were content with having but two children, a boy and a girl. And even
      those poor Moranges had talked to him of giving a royal dowry to their one
      daughter Reine, dreaming at that time of an appointment that would bring
      in twelve thousand francs a year, and full of contempt for the misery
      which a numerous family entails. And then the very Lepailleurs, the people
      of the mill, had evinced distrust because there were twelve francs owing
      to them for milk and eggs; for it had seemed to them doubtful whether a
      bourgeois, insane enough to have so many children, could possibly pay his
      debts. Ah! the views of the others had then appeared to be correct; he had
      repeated to himself that he would never have a factory, nor a mansion, nor
      even a mill, and that in all probability he would never earn twelve
      thousand francs a year. The others had everything and he nothing. The
      others, the rich, behaved sensibly, and did not burden themselves with
      offspring; whereas, he, the poor man, already had more children than he
      could provide for. What madness it had seemed to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      But forty years had rolled away, and behold his madness was wisdom! He had
      conquered by his divine improvidence; the poor man had vanquished the
      wealthy. He had placed his trust in the future, and now the whole harvest
      was garnered. The Beauchene factory was his through his son Denis; the
      Seguins&rsquo; mansion was his through his son Ambroise; the Lepailleurs&rsquo; mill
      was his through his son Gregoire. Tragical, even excessive punishment, had
      blown those sorry Moranges away in a tempest of blood and insanity. And
      other social wastage had swept by and rolled into the gutter; Seraphine,
      the useless creature, had succumbed to her passions; the Moineauds had
      been dispersed, annihilated by their poisonous environment. And he,
      Mathieu, and Marianne alone remained erect, face to face with that estate
      of Chantebled, which they had conquered from the Seguins, and where their
      children, Gervais and Claire, at present reigned, prolonging the dynasty
      of their race. This was their kingdom; as far as the eye could see the
      fields spread out with wondrous fertility under the sun&rsquo;s farewell,
      proclaiming the battles, the heroic creative labor of their lives. There
      was their work, there was what they had produced, whether in the realm of
      animate or inanimate nature, thanks to the power of love within them, and
      their energy of will. By love, and resolution, and action, they had
      created a world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; murmured Mathieu, waving his arm, &ldquo;all that has sprung from
      us, and we must continue to love, we must continue to be happy, in order
      that it may all live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Marianne gayly replied, &ldquo;it will live forever now, since we have all
      become reconciled and united amid our victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victory! yes, it was the natural, necessary victory that is reaped by the
      numerous family! Thanks to numbers they had ended by invading every sphere
      and possessing everything. Fruitfulness was the invincible, sovereign
      conqueress. Yet their conquest had not been meditated and planned; ever
      serenely loyal in their dealings with others, they owed it simply to the
      fulfilment of duty throughout their long years of toil. And they now stood
      before it hand in hand, like heroic figures, glorious because they had
      ever been good and strong, because they had created abundantly, because
      they had given abundance of joy, and health, and hope to the world amid
      all the everlasting struggles and the everlasting tears.

    </h2>
    <p>
      AND Mathieu and Marianne lived more than a score of years longer, and
      Mathieu was ninety years old and Marianne eighty-seven, when their three
      eldest sons, Denis, Ambroise, and Gervais, ever erect beside them, planned
      that they would celebrate their diamond wedding, the seventieth
      anniversary of their marriage, by a fete at which they would assemble all
      the members of the family at Chantebled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no little affair. When they had drawn up a complete list, they
      found that one hundred and fifty-eight children, grandchildren, and
      great-grandchildren had sprung from Mathieu and Marianne, without counting
      a few little ones of a fourth generation. By adding to the above those who
      had married into the family as husbands and wives they would be three
      hundred in number. And where at the farm could they find a room large
      enough for the huge table of the patriarchal feast that they dreamt of?
      The anniversary fell on June 2, and the spring that year was one of
      incomparable mildness and beauty. So they decided that they would lunch
      out of doors, and place the tables in front of the old pavilion, on the
      large lawn, enclosed by curtains of superb elms and hornbeams, which gave
      the spot the aspect of a huge hall of verdure. There they would be at
      home, on the very breast of the beneficent earth, under the central and
      now gigantic oak, planted by the two ancestors, whose blessed fruitfulness
      the whole swarming progeny was about to celebrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the festival was settled and organized amid a great impulse of love
      and joy. All were eager to take part in it, all hastened to the triumphal
      gathering, from the white-haired old men to the urchins who still sucked
      their thumbs. And the broad blue sky and the flaming sun were bent on
      participating in it also, as well as the whole estate, the streaming
      springs and the fields in flower, giving promise of bounteous harvests.
      Magnificent looked the huge horseshoe table set out amid the grass, with
      handsome china and snowy cloths which the sunbeams flecked athwart the
      foliage. The august pair, the father and mother, were to sit side by side,
      in the centre, under the oak tree. It was decided also that the other
      couples should not be separated, that it would be charming to place them
      side by side according to the generation they belonged to. But as for the
      young folks, the youths and maidens, the urchins and the little girls,
      they, it was thought, might well be left to seat themselves as their fancy
      listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning those bidden to the feast began to arrive in bands;
      the dispersed family returned to the common nest, swooping down upon it
      from the four points of the compass. But alas! death&rsquo;s scythe had been at
      work, and there were many who could not come. Departed ones slept, each
      year more numerous, in the peaceful, flowery, Janville cemetery. Near Rose
      and Blaise, who had been the first to depart, others had gone thither to
      sleep the eternal sleep, each time carrying away a little more of the
      family&rsquo;s heart, and making of that sacred spot a place of worship and
      eternal souvenir. First Charlotte, after long illness, had joined Blaise,
      happy in leaving Berthe to replace her beside Mathieu and Marianne, who
      were heart-stricken by her death, as if indeed they were for the second
      time losing their dear son. Afterwards their daughter Claire had likewise
      departed from them, leaving the farm to her husband Frederic and her
      brother Gervais, who likewise had become a widower during the ensuing
      year. Then, too, Mathieu and Marianne had lost their son Gregoire, the
      master of the mill, whose widow Therese still ruled there amid a numerous
      progeny. And again they had to mourn another of their daughters, the
      kind-hearted Marguerite, Dr. Chambouvet&rsquo;s wife, who sickened and died,
      through having sheltered a poor workman&rsquo;s little children, who were
      affected with croup. And the other losses could no longer be counted among
      them were some who had married into the family, wives and husbands, and
      there were in particular many children, the tithe that death always
      exacts, those who are struck down by the storms which sweep over the human
      crop, all the dear little ones for whom the living weep, and who sanctify
      the ground in which they rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the dear departed yonder slept in deepest silence, how gay was the
      uproar and how great the victory of life that morning along the roads
      which led to Chantebled! The number of those who were born surpassed that
      of those who died. From each that departed, a whole florescence of living
      beings seemed to blossom forth. They sprang up in dozens from the ground
      where their forerunners had laid themselves to sleep when weary of their
      work. And they flocked to Chantebled from every side, even as swallows
      return at spring to revivify their old nests, filling the blue sky with
      the joy of their return. Outside the farm, vehicles were ever setting down
      fresh families with troops of children, whose sea of fair heads was always
      expanding. Great-grandfathers with snowy hair came leading little ones who
      could scarcely toddle. There were very nice-looking old ladies whom young
      girls of dazzling freshness assisted to alight. There were mothers
      expecting the arrival of other babes, and fathers to whom the charming
      idea had occurred of inviting their daughters&rsquo; affianced lovers. And they
      were all related, they had all sprung from a common ancestry, they were
      all mingled in an inextricable tangle, fathers, mothers, brothers,
      sisters, fathers-in-law, mothers-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law,
      sons, daughters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, of every possible degree,
      down to the fourth generation. And they were all one family; one sole
      little nation, assembling in joy and pride to celebrate that diamond
      wedding, the rare prodigious nuptials of two heroic creatures whom life
      had glorified and from whom all had sprung! And what an epic, what a
      Biblical numbering of that people suggested itself! How even name all
      those who entered the farm, how simply set forth their names, their ages,
      their degree of relationship, the health, the strength, and the hope that
      they had brought into the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before everybody else there were those of the farm itself, all those who
      had been born and who had grown up there. Gervais, now sixty-two, was
      helped by his two eldest sons, Leon and Henri, who between them had ten
      children; while his three daughters, Mathilde, Leontine, and Julienne, who
      were married in the district, in like way numbered between them twelve.
      Then Frederic, Claire&rsquo;s husband, who was five years older than Gervais,
      had surrendered his post as a faithful lieutenant to his son Joseph, while
      his daughters Angele and Lucille, as well as a second son Jules, also
      helped on the farm, the four supplying a troop of fifteen children, some
      of them boys and some girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of all those who came from without, the mill claimed the first
      place. Therese, Gregoire&rsquo;s widow, arrived with her offspring, her son
      Robert, who now managed the mill under her control, and her three
      daughters, Genevieve, Aline, and Natalie, followed by quite a train of
      children, ten belonging to the daughters and four to Robert. Next came
      Louise, notary Mazaud&rsquo;s wife, and Madeleine, architect Herbette&rsquo;s wife,
      followed by Dr. Chambouvet, who had lost his wife, the good Marguerite.
      And here again were three valiant companies; in the first, four daughters,
      of whom Colette was the eldest; in the second, five sons with Hilary at
      the head of them; and in the third, a son and daughter only, Sebastien and
      Christine; the whole, however, forming quite an army, for there were
      twenty of Mathieu&rsquo;s great-grandchildren in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Paris arrived on the scene with Denis and his wife Marthe, who headed
      a grand cortege. Denis, now nearly seventy, and a great-grandfather
      through his daughters Hortense and Marcelle, had enjoyed the happy rest
      which follows accomplished labor ever since he had handed his works over
      to his eldest sons Lucien and Paul, who were both men of more than forty,
      and whose own sons were already on the road to every sort of fortune. And
      what with the mother and father, the four children, the fifteen
      grandchildren, and the three great-grandchildren, two of whom were yet in
      swaddling clothes, this was really an invading tribe packed into five
      vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the final entry was that of the little nation which had sprung from
      Ambroise, who to his great grief had early lost his wife Andree. His was
      such a green old age that at sixty-seven he still directed his business,
      in which his sons Leonce and Charles remained simple <i>employes</i> like
      his sons-in-law&mdash;the husbands of his daughters, Pauline and Sophie&mdash;who
      trembled before him, uncontested king that he remained, obeyed by one and
      all, grandfather of seven big bearded young men and nine strong young
      women, through four of whom he had become a great-grandfather even before
      his elder, the wise Denis. For this troop six carriages were required. And
      the defile lasted two hours, and the farm was soon full of a happy,
      laughing throng, holiday-making in the bright June sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu and Marianne had not yet put in an appearance. Ambroise, who was
      the grand master of the ceremonies that day, had made them promise to
      remain in their room, like sovereigns hidden from their people, until he
      should go to fetch them. He desired that they should appear in all
      solemnity. And when he made up his mind to summon them, the whole nation
      being assembled together, he found his brother Benjamin on the threshold
      of the house defending the door like a bodyguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, Benjamin, had remained the one idler, the one unfruitful scion of that
      swarming tribe, which had toiled and multiplied so prodigiously. Now
      three-and-forty years of age, without a wife and without children, he
      lived, it seemed, solely for the joy of the old home, as a companion to
      his father and a passionate worshipper of his mother, who with the egotism
      of love had set themselves upon keeping him for themselves alone. At first
      they had not been opposed to his marrying, but when they had seen him
      refuse one match after another, they had secretly felt great delight.
      Nevertheless, as years rolled by, some unacknowledged remorse had come to
      them amid their happiness at having him beside them like some hoarded
      treasure, the delight of an avaricious old age, following a life of
      prodigality. Did not their Benjamin suffer at having been thus
      monopolized, shut up for their sole pleasure within the four walls of
      their house? He had at all times displayed an anxious dreaminess, his eyes
      had ever sought far-away things, the unknown land where perfect
      satisfaction dwelt, yonder, behind the horizon. And now that age was
      stealing upon him his torment seemed to increase, as if he were in despair
      at finding himself unable to try the possibilities of the unknown, before
      he ended a useless life devoid of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Benjamin moved away from the door, Ambroise gave his orders, and
      Mathieu and Marianne appeared upon the verdant lawn in the sunlight. An
      acclamation, merry laughter, affectionate clapping of hands greeted them.
      The gay excited throng, the whole swarming family cried aloud: &ldquo;Long live
      the Father! Long live the Mother! Long life, long life to the Father and
      the Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ninety years of age Mathieu was still very upright and slim, closely
      buttoned in a black frock-coat like a young bridegroom. Over his bare head
      fell a snowy fleece, for after long wearing his hair cut short he had now
      in a final impulse of coquetry allowed it to grow, so that it seemed liked
      the <i>renouveau</i> of an old but vigorous tree. Age might have withered
      and worn and wrinkled his face, but he still retained the eyes of his
      young days, large lustrous eyes, at once smiling and pensive, which still
      bespoke a man of thought and action, one who was very simple, very gay,
      and very good-hearted. And Marianne at eighty-seven years of age also held
      herself very upright in her light bridal gown, still strong and still
      showing some of the healthy beauty of other days. With hair white like
      Mathieu&rsquo;s, and softened face, illumined as by a last glow under her silky
      tresses, she resembled one of those sacred marbles whose features time has
      ravined, without, however, being able to efface from them the tranquil
      splendor of life. She seemed, indeed, like some fruitful Cybele, retaining
      all firmness of contour, and living anew in the broad daylight with gentle
      good humor sparkling in her large black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arm-in-arm close to one another, like a worthy couple who had come from
      afar, who had walked on side by side without ever parting for seventy long
      years, Mathieu and Marianne smiled with tears of joy in their eyes at the
      whole swarming family which had sprung from their love, and which still
      acclaimed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the Father! Long live the Mother! Long life, long life to the
      Father and the Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the ceremony of reciting a compliment and offering a bouquet. A
      fair-haired little girl named Rose, five years of age, had been intrusted
      with this duty. She had been chosen because she was the eldest child of
      the fourth generation. She was the daughter of Angeline, who was the
      daughter of Berthe, who was the daughter of Charlotte, wife of Blaise. And
      when the two ancestors saw her approach them with her big bouquet, their
      emotion increased, happy tears again gathered in their eyes, and
      recollections faltered on their lips: &ldquo;Oh! our little Rose! Our Blaise,
      our Charlotte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the past revived before them. The name of Rose had been given to the
      child in memory of the other long-mourned Rose, who had been the first to
      leave them, and who slept yonder in the little cemetery. There in his turn
      had Blaise been laid, and thither Charlotte had followed them. Then
      Berthe, Blaise&rsquo;s daughter, who had married Philippe Havard, had given
      birth to Angeline. And, later, Angeline, having married Georges Delmas,
      had given birth to Rose. Berthe and Philippe Havard, Angeline and Georges
      Delmas stood behind the child. And she represented one and all, the dead,
      the living, the whole flourishing line, its many griefs, its many joys,
      all the valiant toil of creation, all the river of life that it typified,
      for everything ended in her, dear, frail, fair-haired angel, with eyes
      bright like the dawn, in whose depths the future sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! our Rose! our Rose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a big bouquet between her little hands Rose had stepped forward. She
      had been learning a very fine compliment for a fortnight past, and that
      very morning she had recited it to her mother without making a single
      mistake. But when she found herself there among all these people she could
      not recollect a word of it. Still that did not trouble her, she was
      already a very bold little damsel, and she frankly dropped her bouquet and
      sprang at the necks of Mathieu and Marianne, exclaiming in her shrill,
      flute-like voice: &ldquo;Grandpapa, grandmamma, it&rsquo;s your fete, and I kiss you
      with all my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that suited everybody remarkably well. They even found it far better
      than any compliment. Laughter and clapping of hands and acclamations again
      arose. Then they forthwith began to take their seats at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was quite an affair, so large was the horse-shoe table
      spread out under the oak on the short, freshly cut grass. First Mathieu
      and Marianne, still arm in arm, went ceremoniously to seat themselves in
      the centre with their backs towards the trunk of the great tree. On
      Mathieu&rsquo;s left, Marthe and Denis, Louise and her husband, notary Mazaud,
      took their places, since it had been fittingly decided that the husbands
      and wives should not be separated. On the right of Marianne came Ambroise,
      Therese, Gervais, Dr. Chambouvet, three widowers and a widow, then another
      married couple, Madeleine and her husband, architect Herbette, and then
      Benjamin alone. The other married folks afterwards installed themselves
      according to the generation they belonged to; and then, as had been
      decided, youth and childhood, the whole troop of young people and little
      ones took seats as they pleased amid no little turbulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a moment of sovereign glory it was for Mathieu and Marianne! They
      found themselves there in a triumph of which they would never have dared
      to dream. Life, as if to reward them for having shown faith in her, for
      having increased her sway with all bravery, seemed to have taken pleasure
      in prolonging their existences beyond the usual limits so that their eyes
      might behold the marvellous blossoming of their work. The whole of their
      dear Chantebled, everything good and beautiful that they had there
      begotten and established, participated in the festival. From the
      cultivated fields that they had set in the place of marshes came the broad
      quiver of great coming harvests; from the pasture lands amid the distant
      woods came the warm breath of cattle and innumerable flocks which ever
      increased the ark of life; and they heard, too, the loud babble of the
      captured springs with which they had fertilized the now fruitful
      moorlands, the flow of that water which is like the very blood of our
      mother earth. The social task was accomplished, bread was won, subsistence
      had been created, drawn from the nothingness of barren soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on what a lovely and well-loved spot did their happy, grateful race
      offer them that festival! Those elms and hornbeams, which made the lawn a
      great hall of greenery, had been planted by themselves; they had seen them
      growing day by day like the most peaceable and most sturdy of their
      children. And in particular that oak, now so gigantic, thanks to the clear
      waters of the adjoining basin through which one of the sources ever
      streamed, was their own big son, one that dated from the day when they had
      founded Chantebled, he, Mathieu, digging the hole and she, Marianne,
      holding the sapling erect. And now, as that tree stood there, shading them
      with its expanse of verdure, was it not like some royal symbol of the
      whole family? Like that oak the family had grown and multiplied, ever
      throwing out fresh branches which spread far over the ground; and like
      that oak it now formed by itself a perfect forest sprung from a single
      trunk, vivified by the same sap, strong in the same health, and full of
      song, and breeziness, and sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning against that giant tree Mathieu and Marianne became merged in its
      sovereign glory and majesty, and was not their royalty akin to its own?
      Had they not begotten as many beings as the tree had begotten branches?
      Did they not reign there over a nation of their children, who lived by
      them, even as the leaves above lived by the tree? The three hundred big
      and little ones seated around them were but a prolongation of themselves;
      they belonged to the same tree of life, they had sprung from their love
      and still clung to them by every fibre. Mathieu and Marianne divined how
      joyous they all were at glorifying themselves in making much of them; how
      moved the elder ones, how turbulently merry the younger felt. They could
      hear their own hearts beating in the breasts of the fair-haired urchins
      who already laughed with ecstasy at the sight of the cakes and pastry on
      the table. And their work of human creation was assembled in front of them
      and within them, in the same way as the oak&rsquo;s huge dome spread out above
      it; and all around they were likewise encompassed by the fruitfulness of
      their other work, the fertility and growth of nature which had increased
      even as they themselves multiplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was the true beauty which had its abode in Mathieu and Marianne made
      manifest, that beauty of having loved one another for seventy years and of
      still worshipping one another now even as on the first day. For seventy
      years had they trod life&rsquo;s pathway side by side and arm in arm, without a
      quarrel, without ever a deed of unfaithfulness. They could certainly
      recall great sorrows, but these had always come from without. And if they
      had sometimes sobbed they had consoled one another by mingling their
      tears. Under their white locks they had retained the faith of their early
      days, their hearts remained blended, merged one into the other, even as on
      the morrow of their marriage, each having then been freely given and never
      taken back. In them the power of love, the will of action, the divine
      desire whose flame creates worlds, had happily met and united. He, adoring
      his wife, had known no other joy than the passion of creation, looking on
      the work that had to be performed and the work that was accomplished as
      the sole why and wherefore of his being, his duty and his reward. She,
      adoring her husband, had simply striven to be a true companion, spouse,
      mother, and good counsellor, one who was endowed with delicacy of judgment
      and helped to overcome all difficulties. Between them they were reason,
      and health, and strength. If, too, they had always triumphed athwart
      obstacles and tears, it was only by reason of their long agreement, their
      common fealty amid an eternal renewal of their love, whose armor rendered
      them invincible. They could not be conquered, they had conquered by the
      very power of their union without designing it. And they ended heroically,
      as conquerors of happiness, hand in hand, pure as crystal is, very great,
      very handsome, the more so from their extreme age, their long, long life,
      which one love had entirely filled. And the sole strength of their
      innumerable offspring now gathered there, the conquering tribe that had
      sprung from their loins, was the strength of union inherited from them:
      the loyal love transmitted from ancestors to children, the mutual
      affection which impelled them to help one another and ever fight for a
      better life in all brotherliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But mirthful sounds arose, the banquet was at last being served. All the
      servants of the farm had gathered to discharge this duty&mdash;they would
      not allow a single person from without to help them. Nearly all had grown
      up on the estate, and belonged, as it were, to the family. By and by they
      would have a table for themselves, and in their turn celebrate the diamond
      wedding. And it was amid exclamations and merry laughter that they brought
      the first dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, however, the serving ceased, silence fell, an unexpected
      incident attracted all attention. A young man, whom none apparently could
      recognize, was stepping across the lawn, between the arms of the
      horse-shoe table. He smiled gayly as he walked on, only stopping when he
      was face to face with Mathieu and Marianne. Then in a loud voice he said:
      &ldquo;Good day, grandfather! good day, grandmother! You must have another cover
      laid, for I have come to celebrate the day with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The onlookers remained silent, in great astonishment. Who was this young
      man whom none had ever seen before? Assuredly he could not belong to the
      family, for they would have known his name, have recognized his face? Why,
      then, did he address the ancestors by the venerated names of grandfather
      and grandmother? And the stupefaction was the greater by reason of his
      extraordinary resemblance to Mathieu. Assuredly, he was a Froment, he had
      the bright eyes and the lofty tower-like forehead of the race. Mathieu
      lived again in him, such as he appeared in a piously-preserved portrait
      representing him at the age of seven-and-twenty when he had begun the
      conquest of Chantebled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu, for his part, rose, trembling, while Marianne smiled divinely,
      for she understood the truth before all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, my child?&rdquo; asked Mathieu, &ldquo;you, who call me grandfather, and
      who resemble me as if you were my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Dominique, the eldest son of your son Nicolas, who lives with my
      mother, Lisbeth, in the vast free country yonder, the other France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be seven-and-twenty next August, when, yonder, the waters of the
      Niger, the good giant, come back to fertilize our spreading fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell us, are you married, have you any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken for my wife a French woman, born in Senegal, and in the
      brick house which I have built, four children are already growing up under
      the flaming sun of the Soudan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell us also, have you any brothers, any sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, Nicolas, and Lisbeth, my mother, have had eighteen children,
      two of whom are dead. We are sixteen, nine boys and seven girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Mathieu laughed gayly, as if to say that his son Nicolas at fifty
      years of age had already proved a more valiant artisan of life than
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since you are the son of my son Nicolas,
      come and embrace us to celebrate our wedding. And a cover shall be placed
      for you; you are at home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In four strides Dominique made the round of the tables, then cast his
      strong arms about the old people and embraced them&mdash;they the while
      feeling faint with happy emotion, so delightful was that surprise, yet
      another child falling among them, and on that day, as from some distant
      sky, and telling them of the other family, the other nation which had
      sprung from them, and which was swarming yonder with increase of
      fruitfulness amid the fiery glow of the tropics.
    </p>
    <p>
      That surprise was due to the sly craft of Ambroise, who merrily explained
      how he had prepared it like a masterly coup de theatre. For a week past he
      had been lodging and hiding Dominique in his house in Paris; the young man
      having been sent from the Soudan by his father to negotiate certain
      business matters, and in particular to order of Denis a quantity of
      special agricultural machinery adapted to the soil of that far-away
      region. Thus Denis alone had been taken into the other&rsquo;s confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all those seated at the table saw Dominique in the old people&rsquo;s arms,
      and learnt the whole story, there came an extraordinary outburst of
      delight; deafening acclamations arose once more; and what with their
      enthusiastic greetings and embraces they almost stifled the messenger from
      the sister family, that prince of the second dynasty of the Froments which
      ruled in the land of the future France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathieu gayly gave his orders: &ldquo;There, place his cover in front of us! He
      alone will be in front of us like the ambassador of some powerful empire.
      Remember that, apart from his father and mother, he represents nine
      brothers and seven sisters, without counting the four children that he
      already has himself. There, my boy, sit down; and now let the service
      continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feast proved a mirthful one under the big oak tree whose shade was
      spangled by the sunbeams. Delicious freshness arose from the grass,
      friendly nature seemed to contribute its share of caresses. The laughter
      never ceased, old folks became playful children once more in presence of
      the ninety and the eighty-seven years of the bridegroom and the bride.
      Faces beamed softly under white and dark and sunny hair; the whole
      assembly was joyful, beautiful with a healthy rapturous beauty; the
      children radiant, the youths superb, the maidens adorable, the married
      folk united, side by side. And what good appetites there were! What a gay
      tumult greeted the advent of each fresh dish! And how the good wine was
      honored to celebrate the goodness of life which had granted the two
      patriarchs the supreme grace of assembling them all at their table on such
      a glorious occasion! At dessert came toasts and health-drinking and fresh
      acclamations. But, amid all the chatter which flew from one to the other
      end of the table, the conversation invariably reverted to the surprise at
      the outset: that triumphal entry of the brotherly ambassador. It was he,
      his unexpected presence, all that he had not yet said, all the adventurous
      romance which he surely personated, that fanned the growing fever, the
      excitement of the family, intoxicated by that open-air gala. And as soon
      as the coffee was served no end of questions arose on every side, and he
      had to speak out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can I say?&rdquo; he replied, laughing, to a question put to him by
      Ambroise, who wished to know what he thought of Chantebled, where he had
      taken him for a stroll during the morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that if I speak in
      all frankness, you won&rsquo;t think me very complimentary. Cultivation, no
      doubt, is quite an art here, a splendid effort of will and science and
      organization, as is needed to draw from this old soil such crops as it can
      still produce. You toil a great deal, and you effect prodigies. But, good
      heavens! how small your kingdom is! How can you live here without hurting
      yourselves by ever rubbing against other people&rsquo;s elbows? You are all
      heaped up to such a degree that you no longer have the amount of air
      needful for a man&rsquo;s lungs. Your largest stretches of land, what you call
      your big estates, are mere clods of soil where the few cattle that one
      sees look to me like lost ants. But ah! the immensity of our Niger; the
      immensity of the plains it waters; the immensity of our fields, whose only
      limit is the distant horizon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin had listened, quivering. Ever since that son of the great river
      had arrived, he had continued gazing at him, with passion rising in his
      dreamy eyes. And on hearing him speak in this fashion he could no longer
      restrain himself, but rose, went round the table, and sat down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Niger&mdash;the immense plains&mdash;tell us all about them,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Niger, the good giant, the father of us all over yonder!&rdquo; responded
      Dominique. &ldquo;I was barely eight years old when my parents quitted Senegal,
      yielding to an impulse of reckless bravery and wild hope, possessed by a
      craving to plunge into the Soudan and conquer as chance might will it.
      There are many days&rsquo; march among rocks and scrub and rivers from St. Louis
      to our present farm, far beyond Djenny. And I no longer remember the first
      journey. It seems to me as if I sprang from good father Niger himself,
      from the wondrous fertility of his waters. He is gentle but immense,
      rolling countless waves like the sea, and so broad, so vast, that no
      bridge can span him as he flows from horizon to horizon. He carries
      archipelagoes on his breast, and stretches out arms covered with herbage
      like pasture land. And there are the depths where flotillas of huge fishes
      roam at their ease. Father Niger has his tempests, too, and his days of
      fire, when his waters beget life in the burning clasp of the sun. And he
      has his delightful nights, his soft and rosy nights, when peace descends
      on earth from the stars.... He is the ancestor, the founder, the
      fertilizer of the Western Soudan, which he has dowered with incalculable
      wealth, wresting it from the invasion of neighboring Saharas, building it
      up of his own fertile ooze. It is he who every year at regular seasons
      floods the valley like an ocean and leaves it rich, pregnant, as it were,
      with amazing vegetation. Even like the Nile, he has vanquished the sands;
      he is the father of untold generations, the creative deity of a world as
      yet unknown, which in later times will enrich old Europe.... And the
      valley of the Niger, the good giant&rsquo;s colossal daughter. Ah! what pure
      immensity is hers; what a flight, so to say, into the infinite! The plain
      opens and expands, unbroken and limitless. Ever and ever comes the plain,
      fields are succeeded by other fields stretching out of sight, whose end a
      plough would only reach in months and months. All the food needed for a
      great nation will be reaped there when cultivation is practised with a
      little courage and a little science, for it is still a virgin kingdom such
      as the good river created it, thousands of years ago. To-morrow this
      kingdom will belong to the workers who are bold enough to take it, each
      carving for himself a domain as large as his strength of toil can dream
      of; not an estate of acres, but leagues and leagues of ploughland wavy
      with eternal crops.... And what breadth of atmosphere there is in that
      immensity! What delight it is to inhale all the air of that space at one
      breath, and how healthy and strong the life, for one is no longer piled
      one upon the other, but one feels free and powerful, master of that part
      of the earth which one has desired under the sun which shines for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin listened and questioned, never satisfied. &ldquo;How are you installed
      there?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How do you live? What are your habits? What is your
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dominique began to laugh again, conscious as he was that he was
      astonishing, upsetting all these unknown relatives who pressed so close to
      him, aglow with increasing curiosity. Women and old men had in turn left
      their places to draw near to him; even children had gathered around, as if
      to listen to a fine story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we live in republican fashion,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;every member of our
      community has to help in the common fraternal task. The family counts more
      or less expert artisans of all kinds for the rough work. My father in
      particular has revealed himself to be a very skilful mason, for he had to
      build a place for us when we arrived. He even made his own bricks, thanks
      to some deposits of clayey soil which exist near Djenny. So our farm is
      now a little village: each married couple will have its own house. Then,
      too, we are not only agriculturists, we are fishermen and hunters also. We
      have our boats; the Niger abounds in fish to an extraordinary degree, and
      there are wonderful hauls at times. And even the shooting and hunting
      would suffice to feed us; game is plentiful, there are partridges and wild
      guinea-fowl, not to mention the flamingoes, the pelicans, the egrets, the
      thousands of creatures who do not prey on one another. Black lions visit
      us at times: eagles fly slowly over our heads; at dusk hippopotami come in
      parties of three and four to gambol in the river with the clumsy grace of
      negro children bathing. But, after all, we are more particularly
      cultivators, kings of the plain, especially when the waters of the Niger
      withdraw after fertilizing our fields. Our estate has no limits; it
      stretches as far as we can labor. And ah! if you could only see the
      natives, who do not even plough, but have few if any appliances beyond
      sticks, with which they just scratch the soil before confiding the seed to
      it! There is no trouble, no worry; the earth is rich, the sun ardent, and
      thus the crop will always be a fine one. When we ourselves employ the
      plough, when we bestow a little care on the soil which teems with life,
      what prodigious crops there are, an abundance of grain such as your barns
      could never hold! As soon as we possess the agricultural machinery, which
      I have come to order here in France, we shall need flotillas of boats in
      order to send you the overplus of our granaries.... When the river
      subsides, when its waters fall, the crop we more particularly grow is
      rice; there are, indeed, plains of rice, which occasionally yield two
      crops. Then come millet and ground-beans, and by and by will come corn,
      when we can grow it on a large scale. Vast cotton fields follow one after
      the other, and we also grow manioc and indigo, while in our kitchen
      gardens we have onions and pimentoes, and gourds and cucumbers. And I
      don&rsquo;t mention the natural vegetation, the precious gum-trees, of which we
      possess quite a forest; the butter-trees, the flour-trees, the silk-trees,
      which grow on our ground like briers alongside your roads.... Finally, we
      are shepherds; we own ever-increasing flocks, whose numbers we don&rsquo;t even
      know. Our goats, our bearded sheep may be counted by the thousand; our
      horses scamper freely through paddocks as large as cities, and when our
      hunch-backed cattle come down to the Niger to drink at that hour of serene
      splendor the sunset, they cover a league of the river banks.... And, above
      everything else, we are free men and joyous men, working for the delight
      of living without restraint, and our reward is the thought that our work
      is very great and good and beautiful, since it is the creation of another
      France, the sovereign France of to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Dominique paused no more. There was no longer any need to
      question him, he poured forth all the beauty and grandeur in his mind. He
      spoke of Djenny, the ancient queen city, whose people and whose monuments
      came from Egypt, the city which even yet reigns over the valley. He spoke
      of four other centres, Bamakoo, Niamina, Segu, and Sansandig, big villages
      which would some day be great towns. And he spoke particularly of
      Timbuctoo the glorious, so long unknown, with a veil of legends cast over
      it as if it were some forbidden paradise, with its gold, its ivory, its
      beautiful women, all rising like a mirage of inaccessible delight beyond
      the devouring sands. He spoke of Timbuctoo, the gate of the Sahara and the
      Western Soudan, the frontier town where life ended and met and mingled,
      whither the camel of the desert brought the weapons and merchandise of
      Europe as well as salt, that indispensable commodity, and where the
      pirogues of the Niger landed the precious ivory, the surface gold, the
      ostrich feathers, the gum, the crops, all the wealth of the fruitful
      valley. He spoke of Timbuctoo the store-place, the metropolis and market
      of Central Africa, with its piles of ivory, its piles of virgin gold, its
      sacks of rice, millet, and ground-nuts, its cakes of indigo, its tufts of
      ostrich plumes, its metals, its dates, its stuffs, its iron-ware, and
      particularly its slabs of rock salt, brought on the backs of beasts of
      burden from Taudeni, the frightful Saharian city of salt, whose soil is
      salt for leagues around, an infernal mine of that salt which is so
      precious in the Soudan that it serves as a medium of exchange, as money
      more precious even than gold. And finally, he spoke of Timbuctoo
      impoverished, fallen from its high estate, the opulent and resplendent
      city of former times now almost in ruins, hiding remnants of its treasures
      behind cracked walls in fear of the robbers of the desert; but withal apt
      to become once more a city of glory and fortune, royally seated as it is
      between the Soudan, that granary of abundance, and the Sahara, the road to
      Europe, as soon as France shall have opened that road, have connected the
      provinces of her new empire, and have founded that huge new France of
      which the ancient fatherland will be but the directing mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the dream!&rdquo; cried Dominique, &ldquo;that is the gigantic work which the
      future will achieve! Algeria, connected with Timbuctoo by the Sahara
      railway line, over which electric engines will carry the whole of old
      Europe through the far expanse of sand! Timbuctoo connected with Senegal
      by flotillas of steam vessels and yet other railways, all intersecting the
      vast empire on every side! New France connected with mother France, the
      old land, by a wondrous development of the means of communication, and
      founded, and got ready for the hundred millions of inhabitants who will
      some day spring up there!... Doubtless these things cannot be done in a
      night. The trans-Saharian railway is not yet laid down; there are two
      thousand five hundred kilometres* of bare desert to be crossed which can
      hardly tempt railway companies; and a certain amount of prosperity must be
      developed by starting cultivation, seeking and working mines, and
      increasing exportations before a pecuniary effort can be possible on the
      part of the motherland. Moreover, there is the question of the natives,
      mostly of gentle race, though some are ferocious bandits, whose savagery
      is increased by religious fanaticism, thus rendering the difficulties of
      our conquest all the greater. Until the terrible problem of Islamism is
      solved we shall always be coming in conflict with it. And only life, long
      years of life, can create a new nation, adapt it to the new land, blend
      diverse elements together, and yield normal existence, homogeneous
      strength, and genius proper to the clime. But no matter! From this day a
      new France is born yonder, a huge empire; and it needs our blood&mdash;and
      some must be given it, in order that it may be peopled and be able to draw
      its incalculable wealth from the soil, and become the greatest, the
      strongest, and the mightiest in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * About 1,553 English miles.
</pre>
    <p>
      Transported with enthusiasm, quivering at the thought of the distant ideal
      at last revealed to him, Benjamin sat there with tears in his eyes. Ah!
      the healthy life! the noble life! the other life! the whole mission and
      work of which he had as yet but confusedly dreamt! Again he asked a
      question: &ldquo;And are there many French families there, colonizing like
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dominique burst into a loud laugh. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are certainly
      a few colonists in our old possessions of Senegal, but yonder in the Niger
      valley, beyond Djenny, there are, I think, only ourselves. We are the
      pioneers, the vanguard, the riskers full of faith and hope. And there is
      some merit in it, for to sensible stay-at-home folks it all seems like
      defying common sense. Can you picture it? A French family installed among
      savages, and unprotected, save for the vicinity of a little fort, where a
      French officer commands a dozen native soldiers&mdash;a French family,
      which is sometimes called upon to fight in person, and which establishes a
      farm in a land where the fanaticism of some head tribesman may any day
      stir up trouble. It seems so insane that folks get angry at the mere
      thought of it, yet it enraptures us and gives us gayety and health, and
      the courage to achieve victory. We are opening the road, we are giving the
      example, we are carrying our dear old France yonder, taking to ourselves a
      huge expanse of virgin land, which will become a province. We have already
      founded a village which in a hundred years will be a great town. In the
      colonies no race is more fruitful than the French, though it seems to
      become barren on its own ancient soil. Thus we shall swarm and swarm, and
      fill the world! So come then, come then, all of you; since here you are
      set too closely, since you lack air in your little fields and your
      overheated, pestilence-breeding towns. There is room for everybody yonder;
      there are new lands, there is open air that none has breathed, and there
      is a task to be accomplished which will make all of you heroes, strong,
      sturdy men, well pleased to live! Come with me. I will take the men, I
      will take all the women who are willing, and you will carve for yourselves
      other provinces and found other cities for the future glory and power of
      the great new France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed so gayly, he was so handsome, so spirited, so robust, that once
      again the whole table acclaimed him. They would certainly not follow him
      yonder, for all those married couples already had their own nests; and all
      those young folks were already too strongly rooted to the old land by the
      ties of their race&mdash;a race which after displaying such adventurous
      instincts has now fallen asleep, as it were, at its own fireside. But what
      a marvellous story it all was&mdash;a story to which big and little alike,
      had listened in rapture, and which to-morrow would, doubtless, arouse
      within them a passion for glorious enterprise far away! The seed of the
      unknown was sown, and would grow into a crop of fabulous magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Benjamin was the only one who cried amid the enthusiasm
      which drowned his words: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I want to live. Take me, take me with
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dominique resumed, by way of conclusion: &ldquo;And there is one thing,
      grandfather, which I have not yet told you. My father has given the name
      of Chantebled to our farm yonder. He often tells us how you founded your
      estate here, in an impulse of far-seeing audacity, although everybody
      jeered and shrugged their shoulders and declared that you must be mad.
      And, yonder, my father has to put up with the same derision, the same
      contemptuous pity, for people declare that the good Niger will some day
      sweep away our village, even if a band of prowling natives does not kill
      and eat us! But I&rsquo;m easy in mind about all that, we shall conquer as you
      conquered, for what seems to be the folly of action is really divine
      wisdom. There will be another kingdom of the Froments yonder, another huge
      Chantebled, of which you and my grandmother will be the ancestors, the
      distant patriarchs, worshipped like deities.... And I drink to your
      health, grandfather, and I drink to yours, grandmother, on behalf of your
      other future people, who will grow up full of spirit under the burning sun
      of the tropics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with great emotion Mathieu, who had risen, replied in a powerful
      voice: &ldquo;To your health! my boy. To the health of my son Nicolas, his wife,
      Lisbeth, and all who have been born from them! And to the health of all
      who will follow, from generation to generation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Marianne, who had likewise risen, in her turn said: &ldquo;To the health of
      your wives, and your daughters, your spouses and your mothers! To the
      health of those who will love and produce the greatest sum of life, in
      order that the greatest possible sum of happiness may follow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, the banquet ended, they quitted the table and spread freely over the
      lawn. There was a last ovation around Mathieu and Marianne, who were
      encompassed by their eager offspring. At one and the same time a score of
      arms were outstretched, carrying children, whose fair or dark heads they
      were asked to kiss. Aged as they were, returning to a divine state of
      childhood, they did not always recognize those little lads and lasses.
      They made mistakes, used wrong names, fancied that one child was another.
      Laughter thereupon arose, the mistakes were rectified, and appeals were
      made to the old people&rsquo;s memory. They likewise laughed, the errors were
      amusing, but it mattered little if they no longer remembered a name, the
      child at any rate belonged to the harvest that had sprung from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were certain granddaughters and great-granddaughters whom they
      themselves summoned and kissed by way of bringing good luck to the babes
      that were expected, the children of their children&rsquo;s children, the race
      which would ever spread and perpetuate them through the far-off ages. And
      there were mothers, also, who were nursing, mothers whose little ones,
      after sleeping quietly during the feast, had now awakened, shrieking their
      hunger aloud. These had to be fed, and the mothers merrily seated
      themselves together under the trees and gave them the breast in all
      serenity. Therein lay the royal beauty of woman, wife and mother; fruitful
      maternity triumphed over virginity by which life is slain. Ah! might
      manners and customs change, might the idea of morality and the idea of
      beauty be altered, and the world recast, based on the triumphant beauty of
      the mother suckling her babe in all the majesty of her symbolism! From
      fresh sowings there ever came fresh harvests, the sun ever rose anew above
      the horizon, and milk streamed forth endlessly like the eternal sap of
      living humanity. And that river of milk carried life through the veins of
      the world, and expanded and overflowed for the centuries of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest possible sum of life in order that the greatest possible
      happiness might result: that was the act of faith in life, the act of hope
      in the justice and goodness of life&rsquo;s work. Victorious fruitfulness
      remained the one true force, the sovereign power which alone moulded the
      future. She was the great revolutionary, the incessant artisan of
      progress, the mother of every civilization, ever re-creating her army of
      innumerable fighters, throwing through the centuries millions after
      millions of poor and hungry and rebellious beings into the fight for truth
      and justice. Not a single forward step in history has ever been taken
      without numerousness having urged humanity forward. To-morrow, like
      yesterday, will be won by the swarming of the multitude whose quest is
      happiness. And to-morrow will give the benefits which our age has awaited;
      economic equality obtained even as political equality has been obtained; a
      just apportionment of wealth rendered easy; and compulsory work
      re-established as the one glorious and essential need.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not true that labor has been imposed on mankind as punishment for
      sin, it is on the contrary an honor, a mark of nobility, the most precious
      of boons, the joy, the health, the strength, the very soul of the world,
      which itself labors incessantly, ever creating the future. And misery, the
      great, abominable social crime, will disappear amid the glorification of
      labor, the distribution of the universal task among one and all, each
      accepting his legitimate share of duties and rights. And may children
      come, they will simply be instruments of wealth, they will but increase
      the human capital, the free happiness of a life in which the children of
      some will no longer be beasts of burden, or food for slaughter or for
      vice, to serve the egotism of the children of others. And life will then
      again prove the conqueror; there will come the renascence of life, honored
      and worshipped, the religion of life so long crushed beneath the hateful
      nightmare of Roman Catholicism, from which on divers occasions the nations
      have sought to free themselves by violence, and which they will drive away
      at last on the now near day when cult and power, and sovereign beauty
      shall be vested in the fruitful earth and the fruitful spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that last resplendent hour of eventide, Mathieu and Marianne reigned by
      virtue of their numerous race. They ended as heroes of life, because of
      the great creative work which they had accomplished amid battle and toil
      and grief. Often had they sobbed, but with extreme old age had come peace,
      deep smiling peace, made up of the good labor performed and the certainty
      of approaching rest while their children and their children&rsquo;s children
      resumed the fight, labored and suffered, lived in their own turn. And a
      part of Mathieu and Marianne&rsquo;s heroic grandeur sprang from the divine
      desire with which they had glowed, the desire which moulds and regulates
      the world. They were like a sacred temple in which the god had fixed his
      abode, they were animated by the inextinguishable fire with which the
      universe ever burns for the work of continual creation. Their radiant
      beauty under their white hair came from the light which yet filled their
      eyes, the light of love&rsquo;s power, which age had been unable to extinguish.
      Doubtless, as they themselves jestingly remarked at times, they had been
      prodigals, their family had been such a large one. But, after all, had
      they not been right? Their children had diminished no other&rsquo;s share, each
      had come with his or her own means of subsistence. And, besides, &lsquo;tis good
      to garner in excess when the granaries of a country are empty. Many such
      improvidents are needed to combat the egotism of others at times of great
      dearth. Amid all the frightful loss and wastage, the race is strengthened,
      the country is made afresh, a good civic example is given by such healthy
      prodigality as Mathieu and Marianne had shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a last act of heroism was required of them. A month after the
      festival, when Dominique was on the point of returning to the Soudan,
      Benjamin one evening told them of his passion, of the irresistible summons
      from the unknown distant plains, which he could but obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, darling mother, let me go with Dominique! I have struggled,
      I feel horrified with myself at quitting you thus, at your great age. But
      I suffer too dreadfully; my soul is full of yearnings, and seems ready to
      burst; and I shall die of shameful sloth, if I do not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened with breaking hearts. Their son&rsquo;s words did not surprise
      them; they had heard them coming ever since their diamond wedding. And
      they trembled, and felt that they could not refuse; for they knew that
      they were guilty in having kept their last-born in the family nest after
      surrendering to life all the others. Ah! how insatiable life was&mdash;it
      would not so much as suffer that tardy avarice of theirs; it demanded even
      the precious, discreetly hidden treasure from which, with jealous egotism,
      they had dreamt of parting only when they might find themselves upon the
      threshold of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep silence reigned; but at last Mathieu slowly answered: &ldquo;I cannot keep
      you back, my son; go whither life calls you.... If I knew, however, that I
      should die to-night, I would ask you to wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her turn Marianne gently said: &ldquo;Why cannot we die at once? We should
      then escape this last great pang, and you would only carry our memory away
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again did the cemetery of Janville appear, the field of peace, where
      dear ones already slept, and where they would soon join them. No sadness
      tinged that thought, however; they hoped that they would lie down there
      together on the same day, for they could not imagine life, one without the
      other. And, besides, would they not forever live in their children;
      forever be united, immortal, in their race?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, darling mother,&rdquo; Benjamin repeated; &ldquo;it is I who will be
      dead to-morrow if I do not go. To wait for your death&mdash;good God!
      would not that be to desire it? You must still live long years, and I wish
      to live like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came another pause, then Mathieu and Marianne replied together: &ldquo;Go
      then, my boy. You are right, one must live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on the day of farewell, what a wrench, what a final pang there was
      when they had to tear themselves from that flesh of their flesh, all that
      remained to them, in order to hand over to life the supreme gift it
      demanded! The departure of Nicolas seemed to begin afresh; again came the
      &ldquo;never more&rdquo; of the migratory child taking wing, given to the passing wind
      for the sowing of unknown distant lands, far beyond the frontiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never more!&rdquo; cried Mathieu in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Marianne repeated in a great sob which rose from the very depths of
      her being: &ldquo;Never more! Never more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was now no longer any mere question of increasing a family, of
      building up the country afresh, of re-peopling France for the struggles of
      the future, the question was one of the expansion of humanity, of the
      reclaiming of deserts, of the peopling of the entire earth. After one&rsquo;s
      country came the earth; after one&rsquo;s family, one&rsquo;s nation, and then
      mankind. And what an invading flight, what a sudden outlook upon the
      world&rsquo;s immensity! All the freshness of the oceans, all the perfumes of
      virgin continents, blended in a mighty gust like a breeze from the offing.
      Scarcely fifteen hundred million souls are to-day scattered through the
      few cultivated patches of the globe, and is that not indeed paltry, when
      the globe, ploughed from end to end, might nourish ten times that number?
      What narrowness of mind there is in seeking to limit mankind to its
      present figure, in admitting simply the continuance of exchanges among
      nations, and of capitals dying where they stand&mdash;as Babylon, Nineveh,
      and Memphis died&mdash;while other queens of the earth arise, inherit, and
      flourish amid fresh forms of civilization, and this without population
      ever more increasing! Such a theory is deadly, for nothing remains
      stationary: whatever ceases to increase decreases and disappears. Life is
      the rising tide whose waves daily continue the work of creation, and
      perfect the work of awaited happiness, which shall come when the times are
      accomplished. The flux and reflux of nations are but periods of the
      forward march: the great centuries of light, which dark ages at times
      replace, simply mark the phases of that march. Another step forward is
      ever taken, a little more of the earth is conquered, a little more life is
      brought into play. The law seems to lie in a double phenomenon;
      fruitfulness creating civilization, and civilization restraining
      fruitfulness. And equilibrium will come from it all on the day when the
      earth, being entirely inhabited, cleared, and utilized, shall at last have
      accomplished its destiny. And the divine dream, the generous utopian
      thought soars into the heavens; families blended into nations, nations
      blended into mankind, one sole brotherly people making of the world one
      sole city of peace and truth and justice! Ah! may eternal fruitfulness
      ever expand, may the seed of humanity be carried over the frontiers,
      peopling the untilled deserts afar, and increasing mankind through the
      coming centuries until dawns the reign of sovereign life, mistress at last
      both of time and of space!
    </p>
    <p>
      And after the departure of Benjamin, whom Dominique took with him, Mathieu
      and Marianne recovered the joyful serenity and peace born of the work
      which they had so prodigally accomplished. Nothing more was theirs;
      nothing save the happiness of having given all to life. The &ldquo;Never more&rdquo;
       of separation became the &ldquo;Still more&rdquo; of life&mdash;life incessantly
      increasing, expanding beyond the limitless horizon. Candid and smiling,
      those all but centenarian heroes triumphed in the overflowing florescence
      of their race. The milk had streamed even athwart the seas&mdash;from the
      old land of France to the immensity of virgin Africa, the young and giant
      France of to-morrow. After the foundation of Chantebled, on a disdained,
      neglected spot of the national patrimony, another Chantebled was rising
      and becoming a kingdom in the vast deserted tracts which life yet had to
      fertilize. And this was the exodus, human expansion throughout the world,
      mankind upon the march towards the Infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      England.&mdash;August 1898-May 1899.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
